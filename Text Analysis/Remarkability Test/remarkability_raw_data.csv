1,It tastes like made from scratch.  It is delicious!,1,There really was no preference as I just cut both packages with scissors.
1,"Pillsbury was easier to break apart before baking. Pillsbury “spread” better than Nestle Tollhouse.

Little “box” was more sturdy.
1,"I think the overall taste was mush better, which is weird because my typical go to cookies are nestle but after all of this I think that will change to pillsbury",1,The cookies are much easier to get out of the package and take apart then the nestle were.

2,"I prefer Nestle over Pillsbury because of the size, the amount of time it takes to bake the cookies and the taste are drastically different in a better way.",2,Nestle cookies come in smaller chunks where it is easily able to be taken apart.

The taste is closest to homemade with the convenience of having a baked cookie in less than 15 mins.,1,Both were easy to open.

Nestle cookies require me to break each piece apart which resulted in more handling and trying not to break unevenly.

Which is great because I don’t have my kids upset with one getting a smaller cookie and the other getting a bigger one.,1,"Nestle cookie dough was stuck to the packaging, almost like it softened a bit.

1,"The taste is delicious, moist, & just melts in your mouth.",1,I really like the cute Pillsbury dough boy on the front of the package.
2,All 4 of us decided that Nestle is a rich chocolate and hits your sweet tooth just right. It’s a great cookie with a good chew yet small crunch. It’s also less “ doughy” than the other. ( even when cooked correctly),2,The packaging was easy to open and Nestle was easy to break apart into squares as the other broke off in chunks and not on the lines.
1,They are more chewy and seem to have more chocolate chips in their cookies.,2,I could open the package without using scissors or a knife. It was east to open by hand.

That wasn’t an option for an answer though.
1,Because my kids like this more.,1,Opening the package has no difference to me

1,The cookie dough came in precut squares which I just had to place on the cookie sheet unlike Nestlé tollhouse which I had to cut before placing on the cookie sheet. The baked cookie looks more appealing and has a nicer shape than the Nestlé toll House. The package on the Pillsbury states that it is safe to eat raw unlike Nestlé toll House,1,I didn’t need to use scissors or any other utensil to open it.
1,The cookie is crispier. Not as gooey as toll house. Thinner cookie with a better taste. Chocolate chips have a better taste too,1,Easier to open & see the directions. Easier to get the cookies out
1,"The dough is fluffier, it bakes to a larger cookie size, and the dough tastes a little better. Also the cookie dough is pre-separated, making it easy to grab the chunks and put them on the cookie sheet.",1,"The dough is already separated into individual cookie pieces.

1,I like how big and creamy they are. They seem to be more doughy and just an all around better cookie. A lot of chocolate chips and they cook to be the perfect size and taste.,1,The pillsbury packaging isn’t as think making it easier to open. The nestle is thicker and needs more assistance to open
2,"It is softer and tastes more like it was made from scratch. Also, it is less sweet and more balanced.",2,It was slightly easier to open. The packaging is remarkably similar.
1,The dough had a better after taste. Softer texture.,1,Pilillsbury I was able to open by hand.   The tollhouse said to cut the top with scissors.

1,"It's much easier to break apart into idevidual cookies, as it's not one big pile poorly cut.  They are softer with a lightly crispy outside, where as toll house are just mushier.",1,It's broken up into round cookie shapes.  That makes it break up so much easier
2,I prefer the nestle one because it is just a little bit sweeter and there is more chocolate in it. I prefer the chocolate chips in the nestle over the pilsbury  ones also. The overall taste is just a little bit better to me.,1,It was way easier to open and I didn’t need scissors to open it.
2,The nestle had a richer flavor with the chocolate and it crisped up a little for a much more enjoyable texture.,1,The Pillsbury packaging made it easier to seperate the cookies with each square being the same size. The nestle cookie dough came partially apart making aome cookies a dofferent size.
1,They stayed softer longer. They seemed fluffier. The overall taste was just better. Both were good though.,2,It was easier to cut open in my opinion; not by much! Otherwise they were very similar.

2,Its fluffier and crispier also has a better sweet taste than the other,1,The package was easier to open and the cookie dough came off the cardboard easier
2,The Nestle cookies are moist and chewy with crispy edges making it my favorite versus the Pillsibury. Pillsbury was also soft but not as chewy as Nestle and the edges were not as crisp. I also like the overall taste of the Nestle cookie better and even the darker color. The Pillsbury were good but reminded me more of a store bought already baked cookie instead of one I baked at home.,1,The cookies were easier to break apart. There were no those notable differences.
2,"Chewier texture, bakes up plumper",1,They are almost identical as far as opening the package. I gave pillsbury a slight edge simply because it is a bit bigger and maybe easier to handle

The Nestle was much more difficult to pull apart while frozen, as well, while the Pillsbury cookies were already detached from each other.",1,"I felt like the Pillsbury were easier to open, but I also had an easier time getting the frozen cookies back inside of the packaging. The Nestle packaging ripped more when opened."
1,Pilsbury has a sweeter chocolate flavor,1,Pilsbury was easier to open.
1,The dough is fluffier and the chocolate is not as bitter as nestle.,1,The more circular cut of the cookie dough in the pillsbury packaging makes it much easier to break off a specific amount of cookies to bake. The blue color of the package is easy to spot when you’re in store as well.
2,The dough itself tastes very good. Pillsbury is more sweeter. I love the amount of chocolate chips in both but nestle was more chewy and very good,2,"Nestles packaging was thicker so when I opened it, I didn’t struggle. It just opened. Pillsbury is thinner and I struggles and had to tear multiple times"
1,They are a lot easier to cut/break out of the package.  Their chewiness is very good.  Chocolate chips are good.  They seemed a tad bit sweeter than the Toll House.  Good ratio of chocolate throughout cookie.  They were all evenly shaped.,1,Only plus I can think of was the way the cookies were cut or proportioned and how easy it was to choose just 1 cookie
2,"Richer taste, more chocolate chips.",2,"Both are the same and require cutting, but the Nestle slid out easier"
2,They have more chocolate chips per cookie which makes the flavor better. However I do like how easy it is to separate the pillsbury compared to the toll houseS,1,It was easier opening the pillsbury packaging.

2,"The taste of the chocolate, texture and taste of the dough. More chocolate chips (or better chocolate flavor per bite).",1,"I didn’t have to use scissors, easier to tear open."

2,The Nestlé Toll House chocolate chip cookie dough is richer and chewier.,2,The package is easier to open and is easier to remove from package.
2,"Nestle is so good! They are both decent, but nestle goes above and beyond with the soft gooey center and crisp outside. Me and the kids love it!",2,It is easier to open and separate the dough.

1,It’s a more rich creamy taste I like my cookies on the soft chewy side,2,It was quicker  to open

1,"Easier to break apart to place on cookie sheet. Larger. Taste is extremely better. The Other brand had an undertone when back breathing after swallowing. This cookie flattened out and looked like a typical cookie while the other brand still had ridges in the top of the cookie holding it’s shape from the pressed form in the package. Side by side the other brand looks slightly more appetizing and appears to have more chocolate chips, but the flavor is extremely better in the Pillsbury.",1,"I used scissors to open both packages. I saw that the Nestle packaging instructed to use scissors after I tried tearing it open. I typically open all packages with scissors to have more control of the tear pattern anyway. Once I cut the top off of the Neatle, when trying to open the package to allow the cookies to slide out, the packaging tore in a gap hazard way making the packaging useless for storing unused cookies dough (directions was for 12 cookies leaving 12 leftover for next time. The Pillsbury had enough extra room at the top that allowed for cutting the top off and also was wide enough to allow the inner package to slip out for dispensing the desired amount of cookies onto the cookie sheet. The Pillsbury maintained its integrity and allowed for full coverage for storing left over dough segments."
2,I like the overall flavor texture better.,2,"Honestly, there really wasn’t much difference. Both were similar packaging, ease-of-use, etc.."
1,Both were good but Pillsbury had a little fluffier texture. They were also much easier to prepare as they were individual pieces and didn’t have to break them apart. Less chocolate chips but I prefer that.,1,Easy to open. Tray slid out easily. Nothing stuck to wrapper

1,Sweeter taste even though the nestle tastes amazing,2,Easier to open
1,The Pillsbury was chewier and more most. Tollhouse was good but taking apart the cookies to cook wasn’t as easy and they didn’t look as nice and uniform coming out.,1,"Easier to tear, didn’t need scissors."
2,"Cooks better, more specific time frame. No guessing. Tastes better",1,The pieces of cookie dough were more individual and did not have to tear apart.
2,I feel like the nestle taste better. The flavor is better.,1,The packaging was better because the part the cookies were in was easier to get the dough out.
1,"The pillsbury cookies were larger, and had less of a chewy taste when warm. They had more flavor outside of the chocolate chips, and a softer texture",1,There was more excess packaging at the top which made it easier to cut open

1,Nestle browns too easily and was difficult to break apart. And my kids prefer the pillsbury bc they’re safe to eat raw,1,Not much difference btwn the two as far as packaging honestly. Could open pillsbury without scissors though which was nice
2,There seems to be more chocolate chips and I prefer the overall flavor of Nestle's vs Pillsbury. They are extremely similar in taste but Nestles costs 60 cents lesswhich is a significant savings!,2,The packaging itself seems to be sturdier and more durable. I do wish it was resealable though!
2,They were much tastier. The chocolate was better and they tasted homemade whereas the pillsbury tasted more like processed doe.,2,The cookies came out of the package easier and the doe looked fresher.
1,The overall taste is better. They’re soft and smooth!,2,The packaging is easier to open

But the tollhouse definitely taste better.,1,"opens easier, does not stick to the cookies. Cookies are easier to break apart. Are not as doughy, so don’t stick to fingers. Easy to place in sheet."
1,"We like that the Pillsbury ones have less chocolate chips. We felt like the Nestle ones were all chocolate, and less cookie and therefore made them less enjoyable. We absolutely LOVE the crispy edges I got with the Pillsbury ones because of the cookie being able to spread out a little more. The Pillsbury ones were cleaner to take from the package as well. The Nestle ones were basically one big rectangle that was then cut into 24 squares. The Pillsbury ones seemed like 24 separate cookies. The Nestle ones were messy to try to pull apart into separate cookies and then that made them oddly shaped and sized. One of the best things about the Pillsbury ones is the fact that you can eat the cookie dough raw or baked! We love cookie dough straight from the fridge, and that alone is enough for me to always choose Pillsbury!",1,"The Pillsbury cookies were packaged as 24 separate cookies. Easy to pull out only what you need/want, and was definitely cleaner to do so. The Nestle ones were all stuck together and did not separate easy at all and were very messy."
2,The taste is just slightly better overall. When warm they seem to melt easier in the mouth.,1,Seemed easier to tear to open instead of having to have scissors to cut open.
2,Softer texture and more chocolate chips,2,Easier to open
2,"Better flavor, better shape (less uniform — looks more like a homemade cookie). The texture is good too.",1,The cookie dough tray was easier to slide out. Idk if this is considered “packaging” But the Pillsbury cookie dough was easier to break apart.
2,Nestle has a richer flavor.,1,The package was easier to handle. The cardboard insert was more sturdy.
1,"I preferred these for a few reasons. First of all, they were easier to cook (time on package was accurate and all cookies cooked evenly). Secondly, the taste was better. It wasn't too chocolatey I could taste the rest of the cookie as well.",1,Honestly both packages were pretty similar to open but I feel like the pillsbury opened up along the seam easier once cutting open.
