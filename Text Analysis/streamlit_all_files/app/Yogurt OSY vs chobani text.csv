Chobani Original,8,I like the taste. I like how creamy it is. I like the chunks of strawberries.,4,I thought it would be bigger chunks of fruit since it says fruit on the bottom. It's mainly juice and small pieces of fruit at the bottom.,Thicker
Chobani Smooth,8,Great consistency. It lived up to the  smooth  name.,4,None,Could use a little extra flavor
Chobani Original,9,I enjoy the flavor of the yogurt and the tart of it. I also like the amount of fruit on the bottom.,3,I think the packaging shows everything this yogurt encompasses. I like the lettering that tell there is fruit on the bottom.,I really enjoy this yogurt. I would keep it the same.
Chobani Smooth,8,"Smooth and creamy with no seeds, tastes like strawberry ice cream.  No bad aftertaste.",5,"It said low fat, but didn't taste like low fat.  Was very impressed by the taste.",Larger container and more varieties
Chobani Original,7,Did not have a sour taste like some Greek yogurts,3,120 calories for nonfat yogurt seems like a lot.  Some of the wording was so small on the container I couldn't read it-under the pictures where it says Keep It Real.,I'm not a real fan of the fruit that u stir into the product.  When I tore off the cover the top of the product was a bit watery and looked a little separated.
Chobani Smooth,4,It was very creamy. The bits of strawberry added flavor.,3,The content label was difficult to read and hard to find.,It was TOO sweet! Way too sweet. I would not buy this because of the 19 grams of sugar. I feel as though the protein content should meet or exceed the amount of sugar in a container of yogurt.
Chobani Original,8,"I like the creaminess, texture, and pleasant aftertaste. I really enjoy the thickness of this Chobani Greek Yogurt.",4,"The average price is higher than expected, by about $0.20. This packaging isn't much different than the regular Chobani yogurt, so maybe to help stand out that this product has fruit on the bottom would be helpful.",I would prefer slightly more fruit.
Chobani Smooth,7,"Very smooth, a great taste that's a balance of sweet and tangy. I liked that it tasted more like Greek yogurt than regular yogurt.",4,"The package said it was regular yogurt, but it tasted like greek yogurt.","It was very watery. When I opened the lid, water splashed out. Even when I mixed it together, it was very runny."
Chobani Original,9,I liked the strawberry flavor and the creamy Greek style consistency. I also liked the nutritional info.,4,Try to communicate that the yogurt is Greek style but is creamy!,Eliminate or at least reduce the added cane sugar.
Chobani Smooth,8,It has a nice pink color and pleasant strawberry smell.  I enjoyed the smooth texture and a good aftertaste.  The amount of sweetness was just right as well.,4,It says real fruit but found none.  It was unexpected to have less sugar with as much sweetness as it had.  I'm also surprised it has more protein.,I would like it to be a little thicker.  It should also have more/larger fruit pieces since the packaging says  real fruit .  I didn't have much fruit in my sample.
Chobani Original,8,good amount of real fruit mixed with yogurt  -just the right amount of sweetness  -liked the thickness and texture of this sample  -pleasant aftertaste,3,N/A,nothing comes to mind
Chobani Smooth,7,it was smooth without chunks,3,It was very watery...there was too much on the label making it hard to really see what makes it different from the other yogurts on the shelf,"I would make it thicker, it was too watery"
Chobani Original,4,"It's a healthy, packaged option for getting protein. It's sweet, but not terribly sugary tasting. The design of the package is easy to hold.",3,Nothing,It's almost too tart/yogurty tasting. I woudl prefer not to have to mix the yogurt. The first view of the product is somewhat unpleasant as it's watery and chunky.
Chobani Smooth,7,Smooth and creamy texture. Good flavor.,5,Fruit bites were unexpected since that information was on side of container and not easy to see. I think fruit bites should be on front of container and not side so it is easily visible. It would be nice to have nutrition facts on container too.,Subtract bits of fruit from product since I don't feel there were that many fruit bites anyways. Make less sweet. Place nutrition facts on container.
Chobani Original,8,Creamy  Smooth  Filling  Ample chunks of strawberry  Real fruit  No after taste  Low in caleries  12 G protein,4,%of protein,Color - brighter pink  Sweeter
Chobani Smooth,8,"I like the flavor of the yogurt, and it has a nice strawberry taste. It was creamy and smooth.",4,"I usually eat greek yogurt, so I was surprised that it was similar in protein. The package does a good job of describing the product.","Nothing. I like that it's lower in sugar than other yogurts, and that it has more protein."
Chobani Original,8,Thick creamy consistency and strong flavor,5,healthful benefits of greek yogurt and calories,it was perfect
Chobani Smooth,8,The creaminess and the smoothness.,4,I was surprised that nowhere on the package did it say to  Stir before consuming to get the best experience!,It needed mixing to get all of the products to be distributed evenly.
Chobani Original,9,"Very satisfying, smooth, creamy",3,nothing unexpected,would love to see sugars at 12 grams
Chobani Smooth,9,"The yogurt is very creamy, the strawberry taste is not tart but very sweet and very present in the product, the chunks of fruit are nice and just the right amount.",4,N/A,More protein.
Chobani Original,7,The packaging is nice and it clearly states what is inside: greek yogurt with strawberry on the bottom,3,I don't think you need to say 0% milkfat AND non fat yogurt on the front packaging. It's the same thing...,I personally didn't think that the product was very pleasant to look at upon stirring. I just didn't think that the fruit looked fresh and tasty.
Chobani Smooth,7,level of sweetness - not too sugary,3,says  full of real fruit  so I expected fruit chunks,"more viscous, less runny"
Chobani Original,8,"Creamy, nice strawberry flavor, not too sweet",3,"Nothing, very straight forward",More strawberry chunks
Chobani Smooth,3,I liked that the yogurt had more protein than regular yogurt.,1,I was surprised that there wasn't an ingredient list of nutrition label on the actual cup of yogurt itself.,It's too sour.  It's too thin and runny. It reminds me a little of one of those drinkable yogurts for small children.
Chobani Original,7,Not sweet. Small globs made seem rich/creamy/thick (like cottage cheese).,3,Part almost gelatin taste. Did not have enough flavor.  Why restate non fat/0% milk fat?   Made will real fruit  felt like it was conveying a higher quantity of fruit than in contain.  Preserve yourself  makes it sound like there is something artificial to preserve you by eating.,Strawberry pieces seemed limp/overly ripe-mushy texture. Hard to tell yogurt was strawberry flavor-almost a gelatin taste.
Chobani Smooth,7,Thin-ness of yogurt. Smoothness.,4,Did not expect the thin-ness of the yogurt or the taste to be so sweet. Would have liked nutritional value and label on package including calorie count.,Make it not so sweet! Add more fruit.
Chobani Original,7,The strawberry flavor and the fruit pieces.,4,Just a little sour-not sure how that would be communicated on the package.,It is a little sour tasting.
Chobani Smooth,7,Creamy and rich,3,"No change to packaging, although I didn't know Chobani made a non-Greek yogurt. I see the packaging says classic but I had initially missed it. not sure how I would recommend to change it to increase awareness.","There was a slight tanginess or bitterness before the sweet finish. It's not that it needs more sweetness, but there is a noticeable tang to it."
Chobani Original,8,"creamy texture, strawberry flavor good",3,Nothing really was what I expected,"less amount of strawberries to mix in, seeds bothered me a little"
Chobani Smooth,7,The extra creamy consistency,4,"nothing. The package was very clear,     When I said I would like it thicker, I prefer yougurts that are not thin in texure, even those that are not greek.",a little thicker
Chobani Original,8,"I like the thickness, taste, texture, strawberry chunks and not just strawberry flavor. I like that it has a lot of protein and only 100 calories. I also like that it is a natural color and not artificially dyed.",4,I had had this yogurt before so I knew what to expect but I paid closer attention this time and it tasted even better with a strong strawberry flavor.,Have the size of the container fit the amount of yogurt so either make the cup smaller or put more yogurt in the cup.
Chobani Smooth,7,"Price, less sugar, more protein, strawberry flavor. I would have wanted to eat another one right after this because the flavor was good.",3,Would like the nutrition information on containers.,Make more filling. I would have had to eat both to feel like I was half full.
Chobani Original,8,Very Smooth and Creamy texture.,3,The amount of fruit at the bottom is a little misleading.  Needs to be more fruit.,"A little sweeter,  More strawberry chunks at the bottom of the cup."
Chobani Smooth,7,I like the smooth texture and even flavors throughout,4,Did not expect fruit chunks being as it is supposed to be smooth,"There were a few small fruit chunks that I did not like, especially because it is being marketed as smooth"
Chobani Original,4,I really liked the thickness of it - it felt heavy (solid),2,The word  Greek  should be bigger/bolder to stand out more and the picture of the strawberry should be smaller,I would change the texture of the strawberries. It was too  jellied  and felt/tasted fake and artificial
Chobani Smooth,7,"Smoothness, the right amount of sweetness",4,"It did not have very much strawberry flavor. If this is the intention, then maybe describe it as  strawberry kiss  or something.",Increase strawberry flavor a little.
Chobani Original,8,"The nutrition label was one of the top reasons I liked this yogurt. I love that it is fat free!     Looking at the first page, I thought there were a variety of appealing flavors to choose from.    Taste: The texture was pretty good, but it could have been smoother. I stirred mine quite a bit and still had some small chunks of yogurt. However, I really liked the size and taste of the strawberries!",5,"The only thing i found confusing was the outside package label, it stated  Strawberries on the bottom . This gave me the impression the yogurt would be sitting on strawberries and the consumer would have to mix them together. However, I opened the yogurt without shaking it, and the yogurt and strawberries were already mixed together with a salmon color. Therefore, this aspect of the product was misguiding.","Like above I would prefer a slightly bit smoother yogurt, but this would not prevent me from buying this in the future. This was a great product!"
Chobani Smooth,8,I liked the strawberry flavor and the fruit pieces.It was smooth and had a nice taste.,3,I was surprised that this yogurt wasn't Greek yogurt. The packaging wasn't totally clear as I associate Chobani with Greek yogurt.,I'm not sure that I would change anything. I would like it better if it were Greek.
Chobani Original,9,I like the thickness of the yogurt and the taste of the Greek yogurt.  It was not sour or too sweet.  There was a good balance of strawberry to yogurt and I liked finding a chunk of strawberry.  I like the packaging because it is unique and easy to find in the yogurt section of a store.,3,Nothing unexpected- this is a yogurt I commonly buy.,It would be nice to have more strawberry pieces.
Chobani Smooth,6,"I liked the creaminess of the product. I also liked the nice, subtle flavor.",4,I was surprised by the amount of creaminess and also the limited number of chunks of fruit.,I would like to see more pieces of fruit in the yogurt. It seemed sort of skimpy on number of fruit pieces.
Chobani Original,8,"Thick, creamy consistency - the thickness makes it seem more like a dessert!  Natural ingredients, good strawberry flavor, no growth hormones.",4,Nothing - it has all the information I need and the information is easy to find.,Would rather have the strawberry mixed into the yogurt (no fruit on the bottom).  I don't like the big strawberry pieces in the fruit on the bottom - not firm and fresh tasting.
Chobani Smooth,9,"I love the  smooth  texture and the overall taste.  The texture feels like as it was extremely whipped (like whipping cream) and provides a different type of texture than traditional yogurt.  In my opinion, typical yogurt, is not as whipped as this version of yogurt.  Typical yogurt tends to be more separated than whipped.",4,The current package does a great job on conveying the message of the yogurt type.,I would love to see  fruit chunks  added as this would help to bring out the flavor and enhance it even more.
Chobani Original,7,"I liked the strawberry taste. I thought it had a good amount of sweetness, but not too sweet.It had a good amount of tartness too. I liked that it had a good amount of protein. I liked the serving size. It was a perfect amount for a snack.",4,"When I buy for myself, I usually get Chobani that is already blended. That will change after this study, because I liked the flavor of this yogurt. The fruit on the bottom wasn't too chunky. I was expecting it to be more chunky. The fruit really cut the tartness that can be too much for me with plain greek yogurt. It was overall tastier than I was expecting.",I didn't love the chunks. I like the fruit on the bottom to be smooth. It had quite a bit of sugar....15g per serving is more than I would like.
Chobani Smooth,8,"Tastes great, sweet, smooth",4,"Smooth on the label made me think the consistency would be a bit thicker and creamier, but was still good!","A little runny, maybe a bit thicker, more fruit chunks"
Chobani Original,8,"Product was not too sweet, has a thicker taste (but not too thick) and has good flavor. Overall, it's something I would eat.",3,N/A,Consistency of the strawberry at the bottom might have been a little too thick.
Chobani Smooth,8,"I like the smooth and creamy texture and awesome taste, which was not too sweet.",4,"This yogurt was smoother and creamier than I expected, packaging is representing of the product.","I would have enjoyed more fruit chunks in the yogurt, but everything else about it I liked."
Chobani Original,8,LOTS OF FRUIT IN THE CUP. GOOD FLAVOR. VERY FILLING,3,"NOTHING, I THINK THE PACKAGING SUITS THE PRODUCT.",THERE CAN ALWAYS BE MORE FRUIT.
Chobani Smooth,6,Creamy,1,"I thought there would be pieces of fruit in there,,even though it said smoothe,,it did not have very much fruit taste, I think I would change the packaging to say  FLAVORED  with fruit",Has an aftertaste and needs more fruit mixed in.
Chobani Original,8,Mixture of fruit pieces with yogurt.  Only 120 calories.,3,Nothing,"Have pre-stirred, mixing fruit pieces with yogurt."
Chobani Smooth,9,It tasted like fresh fruit and was very filling.,5,nothing,Nothing
Chobani Original,9,Texture  Protein content  Consistency  Real fruit  Amount  Fullness,4,Emphasize the  non-fat  and  profits better the world,More real fruit
Chobani Smooth,8,I liked the texture.  It was very smooth and creamy.  I liked that it wasn't too sweet.  It had a  clean  taste with no artificial or unpleasant aftertaste.,4,"The package says pure milk and real fruit so I was expecting some fruit pieces.    I usually consider  blended  to mean no fruit pieces so even though this one said  smooth,  I thought there would be bits of the real fruit mentioned on the package.    Otherwise, I thought the package described the yogurt very well.",I would like a little bit more fruit flavor and pieces of fruit.
Chobani Original,7,"I thought the actual yogurt was good, creamy, smooth and filling like I expect of greek yogurts. The packaging is eye pleasing.",2,The large fresh-looking strawberries on the packaging are a bit misleading as it looks like you're going to experience a fresher fruit jam than what was actually in there.,"I tend to not like  fruit on the bottom  yogurts and this yogurt did not sway me to like it better. I wish there was a way for yogurt makers to have more of a fresh fruit, or even a fresher seeming  jam  in their yogurts but probably that wouldn't keep well enough. In any case, I didn't care for the strawberry jam that was added, or at least not enough to make me want to purchase it."
Chobani Smooth,7,"That it is smooth and creamy, has less sugar, is higher in protein than other regular yogurts. However, I my still opt for Greek yogurts that have a bit higher protein.  I like that it is non-GMO. The price is reasonable. I like that the fruit was blended in.",4,"Nothing unexpected, but I think it was wise to have  classic  underlined as at first glance I thought it was greek yogurt..but I assume in a food aisle it may be differentiated by location and that it would be understood.",Make it thicker; the consistency was a bit too thin.Sugar content still seems a bit high for being 25% less.
Chobani Original,8,"Thick and creamy  real strawberries gave it a good flavor, plus chunks of berries  5 grams of live cultures,  12 g. protein",4,nothing,nothing
Chobani Smooth,8,"color, consistency, no big chunks of fruit",5,no big chunks of fruit was unexpected.  the packaging should say  non-Greek  as Chobani is associated with Greek style yogurt,less sweet.  more fruit flavor
Chobani Original,8,There is a lovely thickness to this product. I really liked the consistency and weight of it.  It  felt  like a substantial treat. The fruit flavor adds pops of interest.,4,"The consistency was smooth even while the yogurt itself was more substantial.  That was very pleasing. If I'm going to consume something that represents between 5 and 10% of my daily caloric intake, I would like it to feel substantial/filling.","As with most Greek yogurt, there is a slight aftertaste. It isn't exactly unpleasant, but it is noticeable. Perhaps it is unavoidable."
Chobani Smooth,8,"Texture, flavor and not having the fruit on the bottom",3,No calories or nutrition information on the package which I look at right away,n/a
Chobani Original,7,i like that it is creamy and has big pieces of fruit,3,just how long it took to mix the fruit in,you have to stir it for a long time to mix it all in
Chobani Smooth,8,"It  was smooth & Creamy, It had the right amount of sweetness and overall great flavor.",5,It had better flavor than I thought it would.,I wouldn't change a thing.
Chobani Original,8,creamy,3,nothing,make it sweeter
Chobani Smooth,8,The taste is great!,5,"Well because it's Chobani, I assume it to be a greek yogurt and so because it's not thick like greek yogurt, it throws me off. I would also like to know how the sugar is being reduced. Is it a sugar substitute? I see the package says all natural and non gmo but I'd still like to see the ingredients. The package also says real fruit, so I'd like to see some fruit in it.",It's a little watery. I'd like to see some strawberry in it.
Chobani Original,7,"Pieces of fruit were perfect size,  not too big and blended in well with the yogurt.",3,No aftertaste that usually accompanies a lot of Greek yogurt,If there was a way to make it creamier and to bring out a little more of the strawberry flavor
Chobani Smooth,8,creaminess with a little tang,4,"it tastes more greek (concentrated, thicker) than I expected. I was assuming it would be more french (yoplait - thiner) style",a little more fruit flavor
Chobani Original,8,"Non-GMO, live cultured robiotics good for digestion health, made w/real fruit, cane sugar, taste, texture.",3,Less yogurt same size container is in reality false advertising. It makes me wonder if your quality has downsized as well.,Because you are giving us less yogurt in the same size container. It looks very unappealing - shriveled up yogurt sitting in whey.  It looks spoilt. People eat with their eyes.   I would never pay $1.55 for this. Spend your money on product not advertising. People aren't as stupid as you think. The containers are pretty butyou are downsizing content.  No longer enough to make a quick breakfast or lunch.
Chobani Smooth,7,Texture and flavor,4,I like the product's package. Excepted it seemed like the product was only half full. I also like less strawberry pieces.,Nothing
Chobani Original,8,The taste & creaminess was very good. I like that there were some little chunks of strawberries so you could really tell there were berries in the yogurt.,3,Nothing,It seemed a little thin for greek yogurt.
Chobani Smooth,8,"It's creamy, flavorful, (on the edge of) but not too sweet, fruity smelling and tasting, a bit tangy and affordable.",4,"Looks a bit  like a generic brand design, 2x protein and less sugar was a nice surprise and non GMO is a great plus",add piece of strawberry
Chobani Original,8,Thickness and great fruit flavor,4,Nothing,Nothing
Chobani Smooth,4,I like the packaging,2,This product was neither smooth nor mild as the container label states.,"The consistency is thinner than I prefer.  The package indicates this is a  mild  yogurt, but I find it to be quite sour, more like a Greek style yogurt.  The package states this is a  smooth  yogurt, but there are several small chunks of fruit in it."
Chobani Original,8,Good flavor and it was very smooth.,4,I din't think I would like the taste very much but I did.,I would have liked to have seen actual strawberry pieces instead of the jelly-like substance at the bottom of the container.
Chobani Smooth,7,"I liked the overall strawberry flavor and that it was already mixed in, versus being fruit on the bottom that had to be stirred in. I also liked that it was so smooth and creamy. It was light, flavorful, and filling. It would make a great addition to a meal or a healthy snack.",3,"Having eaten quite a bit of Chobani Greek Yogurt in the past, I was not expecting it to be so smooth (even though the package expressly stated it was smooth, like classic yogurt).","First, while I liked the smooth, creamy texture, it was slightly too runny. I would like it to have a little more consistency.     Second, it had an odd aftertaste - almost like fake sugar or too much sugar."
Chobani Original,7,the amount of protein and had lots of flavor.,3,n/a,Lower price.
Chobani Smooth,7,I like the flavor and there was no after taste for me. The texture is nice and smooth.,3,I thought it would be thicker.,I would like it a little thicker.
Chobani Original,9,Good flavor and I like the fruit chunks.,5,Mix before eating fruit on the bottom.,Mixing of the yogurt and make the cup bigger so it's slightly easier to mix.  Also if you don't mix it correctly you get a bitter taste.
Chobani Smooth,2,The texture and color look good,1,I thought it would be sweeter,Its too sour and has a horrible after taste
Chobani Original,7,the flavor is good.,3,little thinner than other greek yogurt,texture is off just a little
Chobani Smooth,6,Strawberry flavor was good.  Also the tangyness of the greek yogurt was perfect.,4,The tangyness was unexpected in a good way.  Package itself set my expectations of what was inside.,More fresh strawberry pieces.
Chobani Original,9,It tastes like actual strawberries.  It's not unnaturally pink.  It's sweet enough.  The yogurt is easy to get at -- there's no lip to the container that you have to scoop under.,4,"I didn't realize that this was a non-GMO product.  I don't think that I've heard that evaporated cane sugar was an ingredient.  I appreciate that the slogan was punctuated correctly, with the period inside of the quotation marks:  We believe fruit should come in pieces, not  flavors.",It could be a little less sweet and still be very good.  A little more fruit would be nice.
Chobani Smooth,7,"Very smooth, low fat, small chunks of strawberry",3,I think it does a good job representing itself. It is much smoother than what i usually purchase. I like how big a it states  Smooth  on it.,Stronger Strawberry flavor
Chobani Original,9,"Thick,  creamy, not too sweet with a slight tang, fruit on the bottom, with some pieces of fruit, container was big enough to mix the fruit with the yoghurt.",5,I did not find anything unexpected.,This particular product there wasn't much I would change.
Chobani Smooth,1,"I liked the texture.  It was very smooth, there were not any chunks in it.  I also liked the  color of the product.  The  coloring seemed very natural.  The price of the product is very good too.",1,The over-powering taste of sour milk.  I really could not get past that.,The flavor.  I found it to have a very over-powering taste of sour milk.
Chobani Original,6,Texture of the yogurt,3,Like the picture of the strawberry. It tells me what is inside.,More fruit on the bottom
Chobani Smooth,7,"The smooth, creamy texture.  The flavor was sweet, but no too sweet to be overpowering.",4,"I was somewhat expecting pieces of fruit in it, even if just small pieces.",The aftertaste lingers a little more than I would prefer.
Chobani Original,8,"it is thick and creamy, good flavor",4,I think maybe the sugar content.  Also when you first open the container the separation is not very appealing,"I am not a huge fan of fruit on the bottom yogurt.  So  maybe blended?  Also maybe a bit less sugar, but still keeping it sweet tasting"
Chobani Smooth,8,Very smooth and tasty.,4,That it contained 2X the protein.,Nothing.
Chobani Original,8,Thick and creamy texture. Pleasant flavor. No after taste.,4,"I am impressed with the 15% Calcium, great taste and 0% milk fat!",Lower the price.
Chobani Smooth,8,Very smooth and creamy.  Lowfat usually has a funny taste to me but this product did not.  The packaging is appealing and I like that the word smooth is highlighted.  I like the cost (2 for $1.75).,5,The yogurt does not have an aftertaste which is often common with lowfat products.  The packaging should show the word  lowfat  better as that may make a difference to many.,Very little.  Perhaps a tad more strawberry flavoring.
Chobani Original,7,The flavor of the yogurt is something that I enjoy the most.  The texture of the yogurt was smooth.,3,I think the package did a good job of representing the yogurt.,Nothing
Chobani Smooth,8,Has a good flavor and not too sweet.  Smooth texture like stated on the package.  Often non-greek yogurts taste so sugary and this one did not.,5,The packaging represents the product well.  What I found unexpected was the sweetness.  It had a good fruit flavor that wasn't overpowered by sugar taste.,It is a bit runny/watery/thin.  I would like it a little bit thicker.
Chobani Original,7,I liked the flavor of the yougart and the mix in stuff and the packaging of the product.,3,Unexpected was the amoun the small amount of yougart in the actual container. I would change nothing on the packaging.,"I don't know if you can change this, but when initially opening the container the first thing I saw was the water from the yougart. Also at the first appearance the mix in fuit is not visually appealing, looks like jelly thrown into the yougart container.    Do not like that the container is only half full if that, fill up the cup atleast 3/4 of the way or use a smaller container, otherwise it is disappointing and a waste."
Chobani Smooth,7,it was very smooth,4,How smooth the yogurt was.,Strawberry flavor was just a tad bitter
Chobani Original,8,The chunks of strawberry in it.,4,Nothing unexpected. I like all the info on the packaging,Nothing
Chobani Smooth,8,Very creamy with chunks of real fruit.  11 grams of protein.,4,Real chunks of strawberries.,A little thin.
Chobani Original,8,The flavor is good and the texture is creamy.,5,The flavor was better than I remember Chobani tasting in the past.,nothing
Chobani Smooth,8,It really tasted like fresh strawberry.  There was a lot of pieces fruit in it. It was not chalky.,5,I did not expect this great flavor. It really stood out. The package was really hard to read on the ingredients and nutrition label. The res with the white writing was really hard to see.,"I would make it a little thicker, The consistency was a little runny."
Chobani Original,8,Strawberry flavor was perfect & I liked the thick consistency.,4,I would change the price.  It seems too high for just one.,Make the serving size larger for that price.
Chobani Smooth,8,I love how it had a strong taste in flavor.,4,I like how the yogurt inside is presented on the outside package.,What I would change is how heavy tasting the yogurt is. To make it better I would make it more smooth than heavy.
Chobani Original,8,I love the texture and flavor of the yogurt.,4,Nothing. i think the package describes the product very well.,I shake the product before I open it because it helps mix it up.
Chobani Smooth,6,Creamy texture.  Good portion size.,3,Nothing.,Add more strawberry flavor.
Chobani Original,8,"It tasted really good.  Not too heavy of a strawberry taste, just enough",5,I thought that the fruit at the bottom might have a bad taste or texture so I was apprehensive at first.  But it wastn at all,nothing
Chobani Smooth,8,"It's smooth, creamy and easily blend able (mixing in the fruit with yogurt part).",5,SO smooth and creamy,Specify the Amount of protein on the package
Chobani Original,8,I enjoy the fruit at the bottom and overall the taste creamy and smooth.,3,Everything is what I expected,Nothing
Chobani Smooth,8,"the strawberry flavor was deep , II also texture - thick but not too thick",4,the labeling was ok,the packaging I hate the ridge on the inside
Chobani Original,6,It has good flavor and good texture with the yogurt.,2,Make the strawberry flavor better and add more to the bottom of the cup.,The strawberry flavor wasn't strong enough.

Chobani Smooth,6,The flavor is pretty good. I like that it's high in protein and lower in fat and sugar than regular greek yogurt.,3,I thought it would have a thicker texture.,Thicker texture. Even less sweet. More strawberry pieces.
Chobani Original,7,The yogurt is thick. The fruit flavor is good.,3,Packaging seemed fine.,Not the biggest fan of fruit on the bottom style yogurt.
Chobani Smooth,7,I liked how creamy it was and how the taste was consistent throughout the product. Like there wasn't any spots where it tasted like bland yogurt.,2,The packaging looked so cheap. It looked exactly like anything Target brand and you can barely see the Chobani logo. I would not pick out this yogurt in stores because I would probably walk by it and think it was Target starting a yogurt.,"I would make it a tiny bit more thick in consistency, I liked the creamy texture but it was almost slippery which is not my favorite in a yogurt. I disliked greatly the packaging. If they did one big change, it would have to be the packaging."
Chobani Original,8,"I liked the strawberry flavor, it's very sweet, not tart,creamy.",5,Sweetness-sweeter than expected.,Nothing
Chobani Smooth,8,"thickness of the yogurt, and the taste",5,.,possibly add more fruit chunks

Chobani Original,8,"It's smooth and taste's like the natural strawberry flavor. Also, it had a good aftertaste.",4,I didn't realize how much protein was in the product. That's a good thing and should stand out more on the package.,Increase the size of the package.
Chobani Smooth,7,I liked the thickness and flavor of it.,4,"Smoother, thick yogurt, with great flavor.",Add bigger chunks of strawberries to it.
Chobani Original,7,DIDN'T LEAVE A WEIRD AFTER TASTE IN MY MOUTH & IT WASN'T TOO TART,2,NOT AS FRUITY AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED,"MORE FRUIT, LESS SUGAR & A LITTLE TOO THICK."
Chobani Smooth,9,"It has a very smooth texture, not powdery or clumpy.  I like that it only has natural coloringing.  I like that there isn't fruit on the bottom or fruit pieces in it, so I don't have to mix it before I eat it...I can just eat it!  It's not too sweet and it has the ideal strawberry flavor to it.  It's thick, so it feels like I'm eating greek yogurt.  The price is a good deal.",5,"I like that the packaging is colorful and playful and has all the information on it.  However the word  classic  doesn't resonate with me.  I've seen this before where companies use  original  or  classic  and if I wasn't a user with their original recipe, then I don't care.  Perhaps,  natural  would be a good option.  Or maybe a coined term can be made.   greek-like.   While I do like that the packaging is colorful, it doesn't match the almost white product inside, but I think that's OK.  If I saw someone holding that bright red container, I would want to know what they are eating.  And as mentioned above I like the product as is.",Nothing.
