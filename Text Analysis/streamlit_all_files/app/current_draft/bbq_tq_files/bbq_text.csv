581,8,The taste lasts longer than normal,3,"The name smoky BBQ comes with a level of expectations and being from the south raised around BBQ pits, smokers and BBQ sauce so when i'm presented with a food that's called smoky BBQ i expect to have flash backs to when i was a kid growing up in the south and it defiantly delivered.",Nothing
623,8,The taste last longer than usual,4,See pryer,Nothing but i hope you plan on changing out the white packaging
802,8,Like before the taste last longer for some reason.,3,The best way to say this is the taste matched the name.,There's not enough so make the sizes bigger.
581,8,"I like that its different than most low calorie snack bars in the sense that those are usually sweet. The savory is a nice change of pace.  I like that the main ingredients are visible and gives a chunky texture and not pieced and soft.  I like the flavor, it doesn't start right away and it hits you in the back end.  The flavor stays with you, so I think that could help with cravings for wanting to eat more.",4,"I was expecting more of a peanut only flavor.I know thats the main ingredient, but the other ingredients and the flavoring are what makes  it better","It matches the stereotypical joke about Nature Valley in the sense that the bars are messy.  I found pieces in my shirt, table and floor after taking a bite, and I'm not typically a messy eater.  The color makes me question what holds the bar together.  I like a little more flavor than most, so I wonder if you could offer a bold and spicy pack and a regular pack"
623,8,"I like that it is different than most bars because it is savory rather than sweet. I like that the main ingredients are identifiable, I like that the flavor lasts to probably help with cravings and wanting to eat more.",4,The flavor is better than I thought it would be.  I have eaten savory  diet  bars from a weight loss company before and they tasted like metal and not good.,Its extremely crumbly and messy.  I would like to see it not fall apart so easily when you take a bite
802,8,"I like the flavor and how it lasts for a bit, I like how the ingredients are identifiable, I like the crunchy texture, I like that its different than most bars",4,"The flavor was good, better than I thought it would be. It leaves a good after flavor. I thought it would taste most like peanuts, but it didn't, and that was a nice surprise.  I buy flavored nuts and this bar would be nice to add to the variety of my snacks","Its too messy, I think if it was a little less hard/ crunchy it would help it not get everywhere"
581,6,I like the taste and aftertaste of bbq.,3,I went into study knowing this wouldn't be an overly sweet granola bar.,slightly sweeter
623,6,strong bbq taste,3,product seems like what I would imagine a savory granola bar would taste like,slightly sweeter
802,6,sweetest of the 3 products,3,"nice size, taste, and crunchiness",n/a
581,7,"I like the immediate salty taste and the texture overall. There is a nice warm/hot aftertaste that isn't too strong but suggests the BBQ flavor. It isn't TOO hard (as some similar bars are), so it is both easy to bite and chew.",4,I'm really digging the texture. I eat a lot of nature valley granola bars and I think I prefer this texture (a little less hard and crunchy). The BBQ is there and it remains me a bit of it on potato chips. I might want the flavor to be a little more clear but it was the only one of the three that captured what I'm looking for in this  new  product type.,"I want a little more immediate, upfront BBQ flavor. My preference would be leaning it toward the sweet spectrum, maybe a bit of a honey flavor. I like this bar best since the flavor was more noticeable, but I tend to like the sweeter BBQ flavors over the hot (so like Honey BBQ chips over spicy BBQ)"
623,5,I think the texture and crunch is pretty nice. There is a little  heat  after tasting that I kind of enjoy.,2,"I feel the promise of the flavor wasn't there enough. The texture and crunch was nice, better than the average bar, but only the salt was there enough to be  good  for me. I wanted a clearer BBQ taste.","The BBQ taste for me is only detectable in the aftertaste. I get a sense of salt and I like the texture, but the BBQ flavor is lost in the ingredients or the configuration. And then a bit later I have the aftertaste, which is kind of strong, but it makes me wish I had that flavor upfront in the original bite."
802,7,"This one is a bit more crunchy. It is at the edge of hardness. I wouldn't want it harder. The BBQ taste is a little more upfront, which I like. The texture and crunch is pretty nice overall.",3,I think the texture and ingredient taste is slightly above average and the BBQ at or slightly below expectation. It hints at what I wants but I feel the first product hits the mix a bit better.,"A little less crunchy (by like 5-10%), a little more upfront flavor but a little more sweet than hot. The hot aftertaste is just a tad higher than I would like. I would LOVE some honey or similar sweet flavor in there."
581,4,The crunch,2,The smoky taste is too over powering.,Less salty and too much of a flavor roller coaster.
623,3,The crunch of the bar.,2,The smoky flavor is too strong and the bar leaves a strange aftertaste in my mouth.,The flavor.
802,7,The crunch and the bar looks tasty.,3,The flavor is good but could be better.,The smoky flavor is still a little too strong; there’s more of a peanut butter flavor.
581,3,Its crunchy. Packaging makes its an easy snack for on the go. It is something unique that I've not had before. Flavor reminds me of bbq chips.,3,I didn't have expectations other than the label that it was BBQ. I enjoy bbq flavor sauce and chips so I was interested in trying.  I don't know that I would choose this product over a chip product.,The orange tint makes it look burnt. Breaks apart easily and is very messy.
623,6,I like the flavor better. reminds me of Lays bbq chips. The after taste hangs around more.  The peanuts in this one also have a dominant taste.,3,I compared it with the first trial I did so I had a better expectation this time.  I liked the lingering flavor of this bar.,The look of it.  The color of it is unnatural. It did fall apart more but I liked how it was softer to chew.
802,2,I do like the crunchiness. I also stayed together better and wasn't as messy.,1,The flavor is immediately gone.  It also doesn't have as much flavor as the other samples.,The appearance isn't appealing. The flavor doesn't linger at all.
581,7,The crunchiness and the taste.,3,From the first sight and the aroma it fit right where I thought it would be taste wise.,A little more sweetness maybe and the appearance is a bit drab.
623,6,I like the crunchiness and and the taste a little bit.,3,It just looked and tasted like I thought it was going to be.,Maybe a different appearance.
802,7,I liked the taste and texture of this one.,4,This one tasted a bit better to me than the last two.,A small change to appearance maybe.
581,9,What I like about this product is the flavors and texture of the ingredients and freshness.,3,The product met my expectations for the product because I was expecting a barbecue flavor that was not that strong.,I would add more flavors and combinations to people's liking.
623,4,The product was too hard for my teeth I felt like they were going to break.,2,The product did not met my expectations because it's way too hard for my teeth,I would change the texture of it and how soft the product is
802,7,What I like about the product is the flavor and texture of it,4,The product met my expectations because it was really flavorful.,What I would change about the product would be the crunchiness I would make it more softer.
581,4,The savory bbq flavor and the crunch.,2,It was a bit too sweet,It was a bit too sweet.
623,8,The barbecue flavor and crunch when biting into the product.,4,It tastes even better than I had expected.,I don't think I would change anything about this product.
802,7,It has a great crunch,3,It tasted how I expected it to taste.,Maybe make it a bit more savory.
581,2,once chewed it becomes very creamy in your mouth and the flavor comes and goes and is not pleasing,1,the multitude of textures were too much,"The bar appears to be coated in something, not like a normal Nature Valley Granola Bar"
623,5,flavor is not overpowering,2,I think Nature Valley!  this is not that.  Looks more like a knock off,"Appearance, bar looks coated in something."
802,2,not much,1,I think of Nature Valley as a top healthy snack brand.  The flavor is not appealing at all,the flavor - too smoky and this one has the creamy texture when chewed too
581,8,I like the crunchiness of this bar. I like the taste of the nuts and smoky taste,4,I expect good things from Nature Valley. The product is good and crunchy with nuts and seeds,I don't think anything needs to be changed with this product
623,8,I like the taste and the smoky flavor I get with each bite. I also enjoy the crispy pieces that I taste with each bite,4,I thought it was going to be a bbq coating and it is a bbq seasoning. I actually like the dry season better,I think it might taste a little better with a cheese flavored added to it
802,7,I like the crunchiness and the look of the product. I can see it has nuts in it and that it healthy,3,It should have more nuts and more bbq flavor. It is a good product but I would like a variety of nuts,I think the taste is not that much of a bbq flavor.   I would maybe add some bigger nuts like almonds or pecans
581,6,this one was difficult to decide whether i liked or disliked at first.  i do like the tangy flavor of this bar after having more than the initial taste. i like the texture of the bar.,3,i figured it would have some tangy flavor. i expected it to be an orange tone in color. i expected it to be crunchy in texture.,i would tone down the zingy flavor a bit. It is a bit much at first but in the end i think it was ok.
623,2,i like the texture of the bar.,2,i expected more flavor to this i guess. it was just sort of  off  tasting to me.,i would make the taste more of a bbq flavor. i feel like it's bland
802,7,i like the initial flavor upon eating. i also like the aftertaste of this bar. i like the texture as well.,4,"i was pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed this bar as much as i did, after tasting the first 2 bars. this one was the best of the bunch. i was expecting to not like the flavor after the other 2, and especially after the one i had just prior to this one.",i dont know what i would do to improve upon this product. this bar was the best of the bars.
581,8,Crunchy and savory with a hint of sweetness.,5,It has good amount of BBQ flavor,Nothing
623,8,BBQ flavor,5,"Enjoy the crunchy and BBQ flavor, very unique",The bar is crumbly
802,9,Sweet and BBQ flavor very tasty,5,Its unique flavor makes me less guilty for eat it,stronger flavors of BBQ
581,7,I like the strong nut taste. The roasted peanuts are the first ingredient and I'm a big fan of peanuts. I like how the product does not fall apart as easily as other Nature Valley products I have had before.,4,"The shape, texture, and crunch are similar to what I would expect from a Nature Valley product. I rated it slightly better than expected since I enjoyed the peanuts throughout the product.",I would make it a more subdued bbq flavor.
623,7,I like the crunch and nutty taste.,3,The bar goes with Nature Valley and is what I would expect for this product. The flavor is good but just a little strong for me and could tone down a little.,A little less BBQ flavor and more nut flavor.
802,7,"The crunch, the nuttiness.",3,"The product has a similar look, shape, texture, and crunchiness as other Nature Valley products.",A little less BBQ flavor and more of the nut flavor.
581,3,Love that it has the familiarity of a nature valley bar—bbq flavor is a miss though—had a burnt after taste,2,Was expecting better bbq flavor,Better flavor
623,7,Bbq flavor is great—great crunch,3,Bbq flavor was great and still identifiable as a nature valley bar,After taste is a little too artificial/plasticky
802,7,Texture is great—this one has a bit of a spicy zip,3,Great crunch and not too hard; could definitely use more bbq flavor though,The taste is a little off—like chemical-y
581,9,The Appearance It has really good flavor. the way the peanuts are seasoned and the crunch,5,it was seasoned way better than I expected and tasted fresher than I expected it to taste,I would make it a little bit bigger or have two bars per pack
623,9,The Appearance. The Flavor and the way the bar and peanuts are seasoned.,5,I didnt expect it to be seasoned so well and be as fresh as it tasted,I would make the serving size bigger or add another bar to the package and make it a two bar pack
802,9,The appearance. The way The bar and peanuts are seasoned and the freshness I didnt expect it to taste so fresh,5,The freshness and the overall taste,I would make the bar a little bit bigger or offer it as a two bar pack
581,6,"the BBQ flavor, it's not over powering",4,I did not thing that a BBQ Granola Bar would be any good,a little sweeter and little spicer flavor
623,7,The BBQ flavor had a little bit of spice to it,5,"Again, I just didn't think BBQ and Granola would go well together",make it a little sweeter
802,4,the flavor is overpowering and leaves an after taste,3,"This was what I was expecting,  The BBQ overpowered the granola",make it sweeter
581,7,I like the flavor and crunchiness. It also has a salty finish to it that makes me want another bite.,3,I expected the crunchiness nature valley bars offer with bbq flavor and that's exactly what I got. I do like that they are not as messy as the originals.,I would leave it the same as it is honestly.
623,2,"nothing, its got flavor but its more plain to me",2,it didn't have much flavor,add more flavor
802,6,I don't really like it but I don't really hate it either. Its kinda in the middle.,2,it didn't meet my expectations didn't have much of a bbq flavor,more flavor
581,2,Its crunchy it has a nice crunchy texture thats it!,1,It expected the same taste as barbeque potatoe chips they usually nail it on the head with a bbq taste.  Its crunchy so I expected to have the same hit in my mouth.  It it alright but not in a good way I could barely swallow it,The overall taste it barely has a barbeque flavor.  It really taste like a bunch of seasonings that doesn't match well blended.
623,2,its crunchy,1,Its extremely unpleasant to taste,taste the seasoning blend needs a big improvement.
802,2,Its just plain nasty small amount of barbeque flavor,1,I was really expecting a real bbq in my mouth a cookout yet I received a boxing match.  Just a bunch of flavors fightings for a spot.,Add more barbeque flavor and less of whatever season blend chosen.  Use more of a KC Masterpiece or Sweet Baby Rays flavor
581,7,"I like that it has nuts and nature valley, in general, is good for you. It has an addictive savory flavor.",3,"The pictures that I saw before looked great, but the idea and flavor just aren't appealing. It tastes smokey and savory, but I wouldn't reach for this in the grocery store.","It may just be in my head, but bbq flavor doesn't fit in a bar for me. Perhaps tone the bbq down. It does make me want another bite, but I doubt I would purchase it. I feel like I would still grab chips instead of this healthy alternative."
623,3,The nuts and grains. It looks fine,3,I didn't expect it to taste great. Bbq-flavored nut crunch? The pictures looked good. The flavors aren't mixing well for me,Not include the bbq flavor
802,3,The nuts and grains. It's everything I would want out of a bar except for the flavor,2,"After several tries, The bbq flavor just doesn't work with the bar. It is tasty but I wouldn't purchase this","Less bbq flavor. I answered a question saying this is what I'd expect it to taste like, but it actually is a bit worse than I expected."
581,7,"has a good amount of BBQ sweetness. Like that it has peanuts and seeds as primary ingredients. a tad spicy. A good snack when you don't want a bunch of sugar, tho i may be wrong",4,i thought it would be all savory but the sweetness saved the day,a very tiny increase in sweetness and a litle less throat burn
623,6,Product is hearty with nuts and seeds. a slight BBQ sweetness and no throat burn,3,"that the savory would be pronounced, with bbq flavor",slight bit sweeter
802,7,"slightly sweet, bbq flavor is there and crunchy buts and seeds are great",3,"noticeably smoky, bbq, more savory than sweet","slightly less smoke, slightly more sweet"
581,7,"I like the bite of nuts and the bbq flavor. It's light and not over-powering. Very subtle, while tasting the seeds and wholesomeness it says it's providing! I like that!!",5,"I like how it was made savory, with a slight hint of sweet somewhere in there?  The bite and consistency is good.","I could do a little more flavor myself, more nuts.  The bar had started to crumble in packing by the time I opened it, but the level of crunch is perfect.  Too hard would be a downfall."
623,8,I like the taste and the texture is good. The lasting/after-bite makes me want more.,4,"I enjoy nature valley product already, to have the option to incorporate savory is very innovative on the company!",More nuts!
802,8,"I like the flavor and the savory bites, the seeds and nuts along with texture is a good balance.",4,"The packaging (plain white) didn't give me that Nature valley expectation of goodness, but it shine through like the rest of their products.","I believe it's goods as is, me personally could use more BBQ flavor.  But honestly, I think the light flavor makes you want to eat more!"
581,6,I like that you can see and taste the nuts and seeds in the product. The smokey BBQ flavor is subtle but detectable.,3,"I know what BBQ flavor tastes like, and this was about as expected.",Add just a touch of sweetness. Make it a tad less crumbly.
623,4,"I can see the seeds and nuts, which makes me think it's healthy.",2,It has a slightly burnt flavor and look to it. It is a little more crumbly than I had expected.,Cook it for a little less time. It tastes a little burnt.
802,7,The flavor is enjoyable. The nuts and seeds are visible. It seems to be cooked properly.,3,It tastes like smokey BBQ as I expected.,"Make it a tad less crunchy, and perhaps add a tiny bit of sweetness."
581,6,Was a little lacking in flavor,3,"I expected it to be a sort of bland, not really there flavor","Slightly more flavor needs to be added, not quiet as hard"
623,8,I really like the flavor of this one. It has a LOT of flavor and I tend to gravitate towards things with lots of flavor,5,"Even though it is nuts and a bar, it tastes just like BBQ. I would almost pick this over BBQ chips if they had little snack sized pieces",Nothing
802,4,It doesn't seem to have much flavor... This specific product showed up completely crushed and so it was hard to taste,2,Lacking in flavor to me,It doesn't seem to have been as hard as the other two
581,6,"Sort of subtle, almost like a Lay’s BBQ chip, definitely savory, good crunch",2,Too dry of an aftertaste,"A little too bitter - too much paprika or chili powder, very dry finish"
623,1,That there are seeds I can see,1,Just so gross! Wanted to love a BBQ taste but way too bitter or worchershire  sauce taste,"Bitter, too strong of a smell and a pungent flavor that is disgusting"
802,7,"Savory, BBQ flavor, crunchy, seeds",3,"Savory, not overly flavorful but still slightly Smokey and salty","Maybe a bit of cheesy flavor, like cheddar"
581,7,Tastes great,4,Great product,Nothing
623,7,Great texture,3,It just sounds great,Different color
802,7,Tastes great,3,Looks great,More crunch
581,8,I like the peanuts.  I like the crunch and the light barbecue taste.,3,"I expected a crunchy barbecue flavored peanut bar, and that is what I got.",Nothing
623,8,I like the crunch.  I like the barbecue flavor and the peanuts.,3,"I was expecting a crunchy barbecue flavored bar, and that is what I got.",Nothing
802,8,I like the crunch.  I like that they are made of peanuts.  I like the barbecue flavor.,3,"I expected a crunchy barbecue flavored peanut bar, and that is what I got.",Nothing
581,8,In my opinion very similar to 623 but I feel like this one has a bit of spice and not as much smokiness but the flavor is better,4,its very good and has a better texture but I still like 623 the best,a tad less crunchy and more bbq!!
623,9,It the perfect amount of crunch and has a really smokey bbq flavor and I love it,5,Certain bbq snacks ive tried can not perfect the bbq taste and I love the taste of this,add a little more flavor
802,4,"overall only the flavor and not really that, its too minimal that it seems like I'm just eating nuts",2,It seems like this bar is rock hard compared to the others and very minimal flavor,More flavor and less crunchy
581,7,Pleasant strong and bold taste. Spicy aftertaste. Crunch level was about right. Savory tasting,3,"Bar was savory and delicious. BBQ flavour was strong and bold, but not overpowering.","It was a little too sweet for my liking. I was looking for a savory bar, but this was sweet and salty."
623,7,"Savory. Good amount of spice and taste while eating. Pleasant spicy and smoky aftertaste. When eating, you can taste the nuts and high quality ingredients that are well seasoned into a crunch.",4,It's savory. It is nut based. And it's very crunchy. I was surprised at how tasty it is.,"I would like to taste to be stronger while eating. most of the pleasant taste comes as an after taaste, after I have swallowed the product.    In the look, i would make it more airy and less dense, to mimic more the nature valley crunchy bars. These bars look sloppily made."
802,8,"Stronger smoky taste during eating experience. The product also had a pleasant spicy kick aftertaste that is not too strong. The bar tastes wholesome with the nut flavors being noticeable, but not dominant.",5,"The bar was delicious. I was skeptical of a savory bar, however, this bar exceeded my expectations. It is very flavorful, with the BBQ smoky flavors very prominent but not overpowering.","I would like this product to be slightly crunchier, as well as change the look. The bar is very bland and orange colored."
581,3,good crunch,3,didnt expect much,make it more sweet
623,2,"its too salty, dont taste much flavor other than salt",3,i didnt think it would be good,add a lil more sweetness
802,3,its got good crunch,3,i didnt have good expectations about this,needs a lil more sweet
581,7,"Like the texture, variety and crunch",3,"Good taste, just a little too spicy","It’s a little too spicy. Also it’s a little wide - a longer, more narrow shape would be better."
623,8,"Texture, flavor, variety of ingredients",4,"I thought it might be weird, but the flavors actually go really well together. I’d be curious to see how it stacked up against barbecue chips.","It’s a little wide - a longer, more narrow shape would be better. Also this is the saltiest of the three, so lower the sodium. It definitely tastes unhealthy."
802,8,"Texture, variety of ingredients, flavor",4,"Flavor is good, definitely satisfies a savory need","It’s a little wide - a longer, more narrow shape would be better."
581,3,I expected the bar to be a combination of sweet and savory however there was only a presence of savory.,2,Too much smoky BBQ flavor but the crunchy/overall texture was perfect.,I would add a sweetness to the bar possibly more a of a sweet BBQ flavor.
623,1,I like the texture of the bar and that is very crunchy.,2,"The BBQ flavor is over powering, needs something to tone the flavor.",I would attempt to add a bit of sweetness to the bar.
802,4,The texture of the bar.,2,I expected the bar to be crunchy but not so much BBQ and smoky flavor.,Lower the BBQ flavor and a little sweetness.
581,7,"Textures of seeds and nuts, savory",4,Had nice crunch and overall barbeque flavor,"less salt, a little more sweetness"
623,8,"spicy, crunchy, savory flavors",4,Wasn't sure from the first glance I would enjoy it.  A bit one-note in appearance.,Maybe a little more textures or bigger chunks of nut
802,7,"crunchy, spices",3,Met the definition but did not wow me,"A little more diverse texture, color and flavor"
581,6,"Perfect size for a snack, color of the product, and texture. It had a great mouth feel.",4,"Peanut flavor is much too overpowering. The bar is on the right track. Less peanut, a pinch more BBQ and it would be perfect.",The peanut flavor is overpowering that it's hard to find the BBQ flavor. It's very odd. My first bite all I tasted was peanut. After a few bites I tasted the BBQ flavor.
623,6,Perfect amount of crunch and mouth feel. It was crunchy but not too crunchy. I liked how the product was easy to hold and didn't fall apart.,2,The BBQ flavor was extremely overpowering. I didn't like how the product made my mouth taste like BBQ for a while afterward.,The BBQ flavor is way too strong!!!! It's overwheelming
802,6,The product has a great texture and mouth feel.  The BBQ flavor is almost about right. I think it is still slightly a bit strong especially for a bar.,4,The flavor is almost there but still a bit strong. It's hard to really saw how well it met my expectations since there is nothing like it on the market currently. I think that's what's making this hardered.,Tone down the BBQ flavor. It's a bit munch.
581,6,It's crunchy and savory,2,It's not bbq enough.  It gives a hint but not enough.,More bbq.  It seems like it has less of a punch of the bbq flavor than the others.
623,8,I like the crunch and the bbq flavor that hits after a few seconds.,3,It tastes like the regular version at first and then the bbq kicks in.  I expected it to taste like bbq and it does,Stronger bbq flavor upfront
802,8,I like the strong bbq flavor that's left as an aftertaste and I like the crunchiness.  It would be a good salty craving snack.,3,It's a crunchy bbq snack just like I expected.  I'm definitely left with the bbq flavor in my mouth as expected.,I like the bbq flavor but it takes time to kick in.  I would like more bbq flavor upfront
581,5,The crunchyness of the product i like and its not has an overly strong bbq flavor.,3,The texture and hardness of the granola bar is what I was expecting from a product like this .,The bar could be slightly harder or crunchier.
623,4,I like that it is crunchy and i enjoy the texture,2,It was crunchy and tasted like a granola bar,I think the bbq flavor is very strong and different to this type of texture and flavor
802,5,I like the crunchyness of the product,2,The product met my expectation with the good texture of the granola bar.,The bbq flavor is off putting but not as strong on this sample
581,3,it's a bit better than previous 2,2,it's still bad. Just doesn't taste good.,taste
623,3,nothing,1,I love bbq potato chips. But this is simply bad.,"I honestly have no idea, It's just bad"
802,2,nothing,1,It tastes awfully,taste
581,8,nice well rounded flavor. works well together,5,flavors worked very well together. just the right amount of all,maybe just a little sweeter
623,7,liked the smokey taste. it was different,4,usually people add too much smoke flavor and it tastes like a grill,"maybe a slight bit sweeter. sweet, salty and smoke go well together"
802,7,nice smoke flavor. not as much as other one. maybe a little sweeter,4,sometimes getting the smoke flavor right is hard to do.,make a little sweeter
581,8,"The flavor is extremely well balanced. It is a satisfying snack that has the right combination of textures as well. Crunchy granola bars are expected to be a little bit crumbly, but this product holds together well and only a little sunflower seed fell off when I took my next bite. This made me feel like I was eating a wholesome bar with more natural ingredients rather than a mystery mash.",4,"The bar is thicker than I expected for the nature valley two slim bars packed together. It makes it more substantial and filling. The flavors are introduced to the tasting palette in a desirable and satisfying way. After the first two snack tests, I wasn't sure I was going to love any of the three, but this bar leaves me wishing I had more.","This bar hits a lot of my snacking ideals, I don't think any changes would necessarily improve it. There could be variations of sweet barbecue, spicy barbecue and just this current version as the standard base barbecue."
623,7,"It has a balanced, satisfying flavor. It isn't too hard on the teeth to chew and it reminds me of a more substantial barbecue chip. It would be more filling than a bag of chips but offers the same flavor, so would satiate an appetite more effectively.",3,"It has a barbecue flavor and the peanuts are visible. I was expecting a crunch and at first bite, this bar provided it.","My bar was quite crumbled despite being shipped in a box with packaging paper. Furthermore, the product fell apart more readily in my mouth when chewing. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as flavor can be distributed more effectively, but it was unexpected for a crunchy granola bar. I'm more used to feeling the texture of the ingredients when chewing a bar and this felt more airy or buttery."
802,4,The crunch factor is very satisfying. This product has a good texture and allows for an adequate amount of chewing. It stayed in a bar shaped and you can visually see the composition of nuts.,2,I was expecting more of a barbecue flavor. Onion and barbecue usually work in conjunction with one another but I'd describe this bar as more of a  smoky onion barbecue  than a  smoky barbecue with onion,"The onion flavor is overpowering. It is initially very strong and supersedes the anticipated barbecue flavor. While chewing, the bar begins to taste more like a peanut but the after flavor is again more like an onion."
581,8,"While it is crunchy, does seem easier to chew.",4,"It was crunchy but not sure I'd describe it as hard.  Adding a savory flavor to a granola bar seems like a good idea, but one I hadn't tried before.",Slightly more BBQ flavoring.
623,7,"I like the BBQ flavor, but there is a weird after-taste that I cannot quite describe.",3,I wasn't really sure what to expect for a product like this.  I thought the flavoring was decent to my taste and so fit expectations.,A little stronger BBQ flavoring.
802,8,I didn't have a weird after-taste.  I also liked the flavor of the BBQ.,4,I haven't had a BBQ bar before this taste test.  This was better than I expected.,A little less hard/crunchy.
581,4,The same thing as the others. I like the peanut butter taste and the crunchiness.,2,I just expected it to have more of an enjoyable flavor.,"Less peanut butter, more BBQ. Or more of a meaty taste."
623,4,The sunflower seeds.,2,I didn't really like the flavor. The peanut butter flavor was more smoky and I didn't like it.,Not so much of a peanut butter flavor and more of BBQ.
802,4,I liked the crunch to it and also some of the peanut butter flavor.,2,I thought it would taste more like BBQ and not so much of peanut butter.,"More smoky taste, less peanut butter."
581,7,This sample was a lot crunchier than the second one I tried which is a lot better already. It also does not leave any after taste.,3,Th crunchiness of this bar was spot on and had a good consistency. It did not break off as easily and stayed solid through the whole tasting.,This sample did have a bit more seasoning as well but it wasn’t overpowering.
623,8,This product is actually amazing and the flavor profile is definitely there. I’m always looking for a healthier alternative to bbq chips or something crunchy with flavor and this hit the spot just right. The aftertaste wasn’t as bad as I expected either.,4,I wasn’t expecting the flavor to be as amazing as it was specially icoming from nature valley. It was very bbq flavored which I love.,I think the only thing I would change about it would be the amount of crunchiness because I made a bit of a mess.
802,7,"I really like how it looks however, it looks as if it has too much “seasoning” if that makes sense.",3,Nature valley is usually this crunchy and stable as far as a bar goes but not in color of course. It also does look a lot more shinnier than regular bars.,I think will change the way the product looks on the outside and how it’s covered in kind of coloring.
581,8,i like the flavors i can taste nuts sunflowers and the BBQ all at the same time so like that. that it taste different.,5,well never taste it anything like it. the taste is different and i liked how different but good it is.,I would make the BBQ less strong and also the hardiness a little more softers.
623,8,I like that it taste like smokey BBQ and also because is really crunchy and also because i can taste the peanuts and sunflower,4,I think this product is unique and taste really good did not thought it was gonna be that good and different.,i would make the BBQ less strong
802,8,like that it different and i like that it taste like BBq and also like that is crunchy,4,never taste something like this but it taste actually really good,i would just change the strong of the BBQ
581,9,I like the look and the crunch. I also enjoy the bbq taste with the peanuts. This is something new and different for me and I see myself always buying this.,5,It’s new and different and the combination of bbq and peanuts together taste great.,I wouldn’t change a thing.
623,9,"I love the crunch, bbq taste. I love that it has sunflower seeds and peanuts giving my tastebuds a different experience.",5,This is new and different and because you read bbq you think it will not taste good with peanuts but that wasent the case,I wouldn’t change anything about this product it’s perfect as is.
802,9,Love the crunchiness of the bar. I love the bbq taste the peanuts and sunflower seeds,5,This is new and different I love the bbq taste on a bar,I wouldn’t change a thing
581,7,I like the taste of this one.  All flavors and ingredients are just right.,5,I like this one and it taste much better than the other two,"Nothing, it is just right"
623,2,I do not like anything about it.,1,"I do not like the taste, the appearance and the flavors a confusing.",I do not like the taste of the product and its just confusing to me to eat BBQ in a bar.
802,6,The bbq taste is not as strong as the other one and it taste pretty good.,4,My answer is based on tasting this sample and the other bbq one.  This product is a little better that the other one and I like that it has less bbq and salty flavor.,I am not sure what to change to make it better but I like it a little bit.
581,9,the flavor and crunch,4,It has a nice crunch and just enough savory and sweetness,It has a little of an aftertaste
623,9,Its sweet yet savory and i love the crunch,5,I usually don't like sweet and savory things together but this is delicious,nothing
802,4,appearance and crunch,2,I expected it to not have an aftertaste,too much barbeque flavor and has an unpleasant aftertaste
581,5,I like the crunch and that is is unique but it isn't memorable for me.,2,"It doesn't have enough of the smoky BBQ flavor, in my opinion",It is lacking in the smoky BBQ flavor
623,4,"I like the smokiness and the crunch. I like that I can see the ingredients used, too.",3,I was expecting it to be different and slightly unfulfilling from the smoky BBQ angle.,"It tastes like it's missing something. Almost like this is what I would eat if I really wanted BBQ chips but I'm trying to eat healthier. I'd eat it, but I wouldn't be happy about it and I'd probably end up eating the chips anyway. Lol."
802,7,I like the salty/sweet combo. The BBQ flavor is present in a good way as well. Very satisfying.,5,"I was expecting it to be lackluster but this version is smoky, slightly sweet, savory, and the taste afterwards is good.",Can't think of anything I'd change; this one is good.
581,5,Flavor was pretty good,3,Did not really know what to expect,Less crunchy
623,3,Crunchy with a slight BBQ taste,2,"Wasn't what I was expecting, had a very confusing taste",Make it sweeter
802,3,"Crunchy, good nutty flavor",3,I didn't really know what to expect although the BBQ flavor was not very strong.  Was more of a nutty flavor,Make the flavor stronger
581,9,I love the savory taste. You taste a hint of barbeque and a very nutty flavor.,5,The flavor is amazing. You taste a hint of bbq and  a nutty flavor. It goes very well together.,I would just make it a little bit softer.
623,9,I love the flavors of barbeque and peanuts. They blend together nicely. It is also not too hard to bite into.,5,I love the crunchiness and the flavors. I love the barbeque and nutty flavors.  It is also not too hard to bite into.,I would just make this product a bit larger.
802,9,I love the barbeque flavor. I love that you can see and taste the peanuts in bar.,5,"I thought the barbeque flavor was going to be really strong and overpowering, but it was a great smoky flavor. I wanted to keep eating the bar.",I would also make a softer version of this bar.
581,2,"Very crunchy, slightly softer.  Good appearance.  Can see and taste more of the nuts in this one.",2,Not nearly enough flavor.  Kind of a flavorless bar.,Needs more flavor.
623,8,"Good amount of flavor.  This is my favorite of the 3.  It may be the softest.  No residue on hands.  The flavor is not over-powering like the first one, and has more flavor than the second one.",4,It has a smoky BBQ taste.  You can taste the nuts as well.,"Needs a little bit more flavor, like 10-20 percent stronger."
802,4,"Very crunchy, strong flavor.",2,"It has the most flavor of the three bars, but perhaps too much.  The after taste is over-powering, and I am concerned about my breath now.",Strong after taste.  I would be looking for a mint or mouthwash after finishing it.
581,7,I am a big bbq fan of practically everything and this has a distinct smoked bbq taste the aftertaste is very firm and constant,4,"i don't normally associate a nature valley crunchy snack/breakfast bar with bbq rather peanut butter, almonds, and granola. I thought the initial thought of a bbq bar was sort of gross, but it really blew away my very low expectations",nothing substantial comes to mind. maybe a darker color to which I associate bbq being
623,7,The consistent aftertaste and texture,4,I don't normally put this combo together via bbq and a granola bar,nothing comes to mind
802,7,It leaves a similar after taste compared to a BBQ chip,4,i think of a breakfast bar and BBQ is not a flavor that I am used to with a NV bar,nothing comes to mind
581,9,Great sweet and salty taste.,5,Product  was the right balance between each flavor; wasn't too salty or too sweet. Didn't have any lingering aftertaste.,I wouldn't make any changes to this product.
623,8,The first bite has a subtle BBQ flavor and the salty/savory flavor is released after chewing. There's a sweet aftertaste.,4,"I wasn't expecting the first bite to have such an enjoyable, subtle, BBQ flavor. I anticipated that it was going to be overwhelming and have a lingering aftertaste, however it did not.",I would use cashews instead of peanuts.
802,2,I like the hint of BBQ flavor you taste after the initial bite.,2,"I was expecting a sweeter BBQ flavor, not something so close to tasting like charcoal. It was a burnt flavor to it.","The smokey taste, and the lingering aftertaste, are not appealing. I would enjoy the BBQ flavor without the smokiness. The bar tastes as if it's been burnt/spent too much time on the grill."
581,9,"It's very flavorful. Much more savory than sweet. The crunch and texture is unexpected because the bar is on the thinner side, but I really like it",5,It packs serious flavor in a small bite. Looking at it at first I really didn't expect it,Maybe make it a touch more salty.
623,9,It's very savory and full of flavor. It's crunchier than I expected.,5,The flavor is really amazing. Small bite packs lots of flavor,Make a bar a little bigger
802,9,"It's very flavorful, crunchy, sweet and savory at once. I like the texture too. It's not as hard as it looks to be originally but it has a good crunch",5,"The product doesn't look like it'll pack as much flavor as it actually does. It looks appetizing, but I didn't expect that much flavor to come through","I like that its sweet and savory, but after taking another bite I'm looking for more savory than sweet. Maybe very slightly tone down sweetness"
581,2,I like the size and the fact that you could see the seeds in it,2,I thought it would be sweeter and more savory,The overall taste
623,7,It has a sweet taste to it,3,The size and the sweet taste how get when eating it was great,I think adding a little more nut taste with this one would make the flavor better
802,3,I like that is bar and the right size,2,I did not like the BBQ flavoring . It did not mix well with the nut taste,Make it more sweet
581,4,i didn't really like it. flavor wasn't good to me,2,i didn't like the flavor,better flavor
623,6,not great flavor,2,i didn't like the flavor,better flavor
802,7,it has pretty decent flavor  crunchy  not very salty to me,4,"flavor is better than i expected, but could be better, i think","it has good flavor, but i think it could be a bit bolder"
581,7,Flavor and consistency,4,Crunchy and appetizing,Nothing
623,7,Flavor and consistency,3,The flavor matches,Nothing
802,7,bbq flavor is unique,3,Because it tastes the way it is described,"nothing, it's flavorful"
581,6,The bar was great tasting it just didn’t taste as much like barbecue as I would’ve liked. I liked the strong roasted nut flavor but I would’ve liked a stronger barbecue flavor. The overall taste and aftertaste was good it was still enjoyable.,2,"The flavor was good, but the barbecue left a little to be desired.",More barbecue I would’ve liked. The bar wasn’t as robust as the previous bar where I liked the strong flavor. Adding more spice or flavor to get a fuller first bite is what I recommend.
623,7,"The bar has a unique taste, it has a strong barbecue taste but also strong roasted nut taste. I like the appetizing flavor and after taste. The bar isn't too much of either and I can take multiple bites and still want more.",3,I tasted the barbecue and nut crunch as advertised. The bar delivered on the flavor and is unique.,I would increase the barbecue flavor and strengthen the after taste. This would make the flavor more bold and craveable. The first bite is a bit flat and I think more barbecue flavor can fix that.
802,8,I like the strong barbecue flavor and the nutty texture the bar has. It’s flavor is strong and hits you immediately. I also like the aftertaste it tastes like bbq ribs and it lasts a long time. I enjoyed this bar very much.,5,I didn’t expect the taste to be as strong as it was but was pleasantly surprised. This bar met the goal of combining a barbecue and nutty taste that can satisfy a craving and have an enjoyable taste that makes you want more.,If I could change something I would make it a bit softer because it breaks apart easily.
581,5,The subtle hint of bbq,3,The crunch and appearance are as I expected them to be.,"Maybe adding more bbq, the flavor is fine. There just needs to be more bbq"
623,1,The crunch,1,The crunch and appearance,The taste of this I very weird and leaves a nasty aftertaste. It’d like a smoky bbq but not a good one. When you first bite it you don’t get any flavor. It’s only in the aftertaste.
802,4,This product taste the most like BBQ of the three and has a nice crunch.,3,This has a mesquite bbq taste and that’s what I thought it’d taste like based on the smell and ingredients.,Having more of the BBQ taste and a little more sweetness.
581,6,The balance of the flavor was too off and it was too salty.,2,It was too salty for my liking and did not have a good balance of flavor,It would be better if it was less salty
623,7,This one had a better balance of sweet and savory and the crunch was tasty.,3,It was just as I expect with the balance of flavor and crunch,I would make the biscuit a bit thicker
802,8,I like the sweet and savory taste of BBQ for this bar. It is a good balance of flavors and is enjoyable.,3,It was the flavor and the balance of crunch and sweet I was expecting,I would dial down on the smoke flavor .
581,8,I like the mixture of the bbq flavor and nuts,4,Its very yummy and a great combination of flavors,I would maybe leave the nuts in bigger pieces.
623,9,I love the bbq flavor,5,The flavor combination is amazing and has such a good texture,nothing. I think it's perfect
802,8,I really enjoyed the savory flavor.  There is a great combination of nutty flavor and bbq flavor,4,I didn't really have a solid expectation when thinking of a granola bar.. but this is like a trail mix or bar mix. So yummy,I think I would add a bit more of the bbq flavor
581,3,I did not like this product it was sweet and savory and the taste was off,1,It has a sweet hint,Can this product and use the first sample or last sample
623,7,Good flavor tastes almost identical to sample 1,4,I was expecting it to taste bad but it was much better than I anticipated,Maybe less onion powder
802,6,Its savory the flavors and scent are over powering I am not sure if I would want to eat this on the go,4,I really can taste the bbq flavor. Reminds me of bbq potato chips,Somehow mask the scent more I feel like my breath smells now
581,8,I like the light BBQ flavor and the crunchiness.,4,I was not expecting it to taste so good because i have never a savory type of crunchy bar.,"Maybe a little sweeter, like a sweet light BBQ flavor."
623,8,I like the BBQ flavor and the sweetness. Its a little more sweeter than the other bars.,4,I dont taste any smoky-ness flavor,"It has less BBQ flavor, so maybe a stronger BBQ flavor."
802,8,I like the BBQ Flavor. I like that it is savory. I like the crunchiness.,4,i honestly thought it might be nasty as i have never had a savory type of crunchy bar.,Maybe a little more sweeter as i like sweet BBQ flavors.
581,4,The crunchiness,2,It didn’t really have a good taste to it,The flavor is off
623,6,It’s crunchy and savory,4,It’s surprisingly very  wholesome and tasty,Add a little sweet
802,7,The savory the bbq flavor really stands out and the crunchiness,4,I expected it to be nasty because when you think nature valley u don’t  Think savory but this reminded me of eating a bag of bbq chips  Or bbq chicken very wholesome,Mayb the appearance Mayb add a little sweet but with the bbq flavor very present
581,7,"nice crunch, not too strong of a bbq flavor",4,i enjoyed the bar,nothing
623,4,A little too strong of a bbq smell,2,thought the flavor would be more nutty,cut the bbq flavor
802,3,Don't like the bbq flavor. It has a weird aftertaste,2,found the flavor very fake,discontinue it
581,8,I like the flavor and the crunch. Doesn't have as much smoky flavor as the previous bar and not as strong of an aftertaste.,2,It is a very light smoke and bbq flavor not very strong or bold.,"I would add more BBQ flavoring in, it seams like its missing a little bit."
623,7,"Not a very strong flavor, could use more smoke and BBQ",2,It isn't as flavorful after having a few bites. NO good lingering aftertaste either,"Add more flavoring either stronger BBQ and/or smoke, probably both"
802,8,"I love the smoky flavor, it stays with you for awhile. It's not spicy but I taste a small amount of heat. Good crunch",5,It has an overall great combo of flavor of smoke and BBQ. not over bearing and long lasting aftertaste that makes me want to take another bite,Nothing I believe this one is my favorite.
581,6,I like the BBQ that is left in my mouth after I finish eating it as well as the peanuts and texture.,2,"Again, this one had a bit of a sweet aftertaste to it, which overwhelmed the BBQ flavor.","I feel like it's too sweet, I wish it was more savory. I can see myself feeling sick afterwards."
623,7,i like that it has a very savory and smokey taste. There is no sweet aftertaste.,3,The taste matches the name and the level of BBQ I can taste in the bar. It's not too overpowering.,I really don't like how it's so crumbly
802,8,"I like the texture of the peanuts and seeds. I also like the smokey BBQ flavoring. It has a nice aftertaste, and I like the crunch of the peanuts.",4,"I have eaten several Nature Valley granola bars in the past, and they have all been very sweet. It was very unexpected for it to have such a savory taste. It's not what I would normally expect from the brand.","It's very crumbly, and it makes quite a mess. Otherwise, I think it's an interesting take on the Nature Valley brand."
581,7,I enjoyed the crunch to this one and it was more dense than the previous so I like that. I like the overall barbecue flavor because it did have a nice sweetness to it and it seemed like it had more nuts which was a good thing for me. Overall it had a good balance of salty and sweet from the barbecue flavor,4,Thinking of Nature's Valley I think sweet and granola bars and this was a nice surprise with a good BBQ Jesus that was for Smokey and a sweep and had a nice crunch to it without being dry or too dense,Honestly for this product I can't think of anything that I would want to change except to maybe make it bigger because I would want more
623,6,I like that it has a nice crunch to it and there's more of a sweet barbecue flavor,3,It seems like a typical barbecue snack. The flavor itself is sort of generic and what I would expect. it's not something special that really stands out however,I feel like this one could definitely be denser because there is a nice crunch but then like the first one it crumbles a little. Also the barbecue flavor is a little too sweet for me
802,4,I like the crunch to it,2,"The BBQ taste was too intense and I didn't feel like it was a satisfying BBQ flavor. It was way too smokey in the flavor, so much so that it was overpowering and I couldn't taste anything else besides the smoke",It was too crumbly.  I expected it to be more crunchy but the bar just sort of crumbled in my mouth after taking a bite and it wasn't very dense. It seemed like it was going to be a solid crunchy kind of snack but was exactly the opposite so I would prefer to see it have a more solid consistency.
581,6,"The peanut flavor is good. It has less heat, so thats nice too.",2,I don't really taste the BBQ. It's more faint.,Stronger BBQ flavor without the heat that comes with it. The BBQ flavor seems to be much more subtle with this sample.
623,8,"This was the only sample not broken, but it just looks better. Better BBQ flavor, although it's a little too spicy.",4,Just impressive to impart this flavor in a nut bar. It's different.,More BBQ flavor less heat
802,8,"It's very unique, doesn't remind me of anything I've tasted before. I love the nutty smoky BBQ flavor.",4,"I don't gravitate towards smoky flavor because it tends to linger throughout the day, it's definitely smoky, but not how I anticipated.","It's very savory, a kick of sweet/acid or something could temper the kick of the smoky BBQ seasoning. If would be nice if the the peanuts had some kind of mildly sweet taste. I wasn't expecting it to be spicy."
581,3,The appearance. The product appears to be very appetizing.,3,"The flavor is missing something. I taste the smokiness; however, it is missing the BBQ.","The taste. There is not enough flavor on the product, to me."
623,5,I like the appearance of the product. The product appears as though it will be tasty.,3,The product is not as good as expected.,Add more sweetness to the taste.
802,2,"I like the appearance of the product. The seeds and nuts. However, it does not have a sweet or savory taste to it. It's as though it is missing something. There is a strange after taste after eating the product as well. I am not sure if it is the nuts, seed or light BBQ that gives that taste. I don't like it.",2,"I like BBQ and I like nuts; however, the combination together is a no.",I would make this product either sweeter adding some fruits (cranberries or raisin) or more of a BBQ taste.
581,1,The crunchy is great. I also like that I can see the seeds and peanuts.,1,I didn’t like this bar at all. It left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.,The smokeness is too much for me.
623,6,The texture and it doesn’t leave a bitter taste in my mouth.,3,This bar is okay. It can be better.,I would get rid of the heat in it. It also needs more sweetness.
802,6,The crunch is very good. I also like the nuts and seeds.,2,The barbecue flavor doesn’t taste good.,The barbecue flavor tastes plasticky to me. I don’t like it.
581,6,It’s got a sweet aspect to it. And not too bbq flavored compared to the last one.,4,It’s got that sweet aspect,Stronger flavor
623,4,It’s got a nice flavor to it,3,It tasted like you’d think it would.,A more distinct flavor would be nice. It tasted like Chex mix to me.
802,4,I just personally don’t really like BBQ flavored things.,3,It’s a good product. I’m just not much for BBQ flavor in general.,"I mean it’s not a bad product, maybe add some other flavors."
581,6,Crunchy,3,BBQ crunchy bar,More savory flavors
623,6,Crunchy,3,"Hard to capture bbq flavor, so I wasn’t surprised",More flavor
802,4,Crunchiness,3,Name clued me in to what it may taste like,More savory
581,2,I like the crunchy texture,2,BBQ flavor was too over powering and didn't mix well with other ingredients,Flavors did not mix well together
623,3,The texture and crunch,2,The flavors didn't go well together and the BBQ flavor was too much,The BBQ flavor is too much with other ingredients
802,1,I like the crunchiness of it,2,The BBQ flavor was too much.,On paper the ingredients sound good together but did not taste well together. Think there was too much BBQ flavor
581,8,The taste was amazing! I loved the crunchiness also!,4,This product was exactly what I thought it would be and more! I love the flavor!,Add more sweetness
623,2,Did not like the taste nor the crunchiness. The appearance was appealing,2,Did not expect it to taste the way it did,Taste and flavor
802,2,The appearance of the product is acceptable.,1,I did not like the taste of the product.,The taste overall.
581,1,"Although this bar tastes slightly less smoky, it still has a flat, unsatisfactory taste and profile. Again - more honey, sweet flavors are needed.",2,Not a flavor I would expect from Nature Valley. The crunchy and wholesome factors are still present and familiar.,More honey and sweet notes.
623,1,"Flavor profile is too smoky and flat, unsatisfactory aftertaste. Needs a less smoky and BBQ flavor and more honey, sweet flavors.",2,Not the flavor combination or profile I would expect. Honestly it tastes cheap and uninspired. Similar to a quick stop snack I can purchase that is not a trusted name brand.,"Needs a less smoky and BBQ flavor and more honey, sweet flavors. Overall I do not think this was a great idea for a Nature Valley bar. The BBQ is not interesting."
802,1,The smoky taste is overwhelming; after taste is displeasing; flavors profile is confusing at times; does not sit well with my aesthetic when it comes to nut bars and flavor,1,"I'm a fan of Nature Valley but I'm not at all pleased by this bar. As stated before, smoke flavor is too much. I would like to have more of the sweet and honey flavor that Nature Valley does well.",I don't think you can make this Smoky BBQ flavored bar better in my opinion; I would more than likely not eat a nut bar flavored like BBQ - possibly lessen the smokey flavor and increase the sweet additive - maybe a slight bit of honey
581,6,I guess since it is subtle between sweet and savory,2,I was underwhelmed with the flavor.  I think their other bars are much better,"It has an aftertaste - it needs a bit more spice or go in the other direction with sweetness, like maple.  Add tomato and salt flavors and maybe pepper"
623,6,It's a nice tangy sweet mix,3,"I was not sure what the mix was going to be but the second time I tried it, it was better.","probably add a bit of tomato, saltiness and pepper to it"
802,4,Interesting taste at first in terms of the spiciness,2,It looked appetizing but needs a better taste combination - maybe introduce a tomato flavor more or go sweeter,"It has an aftertaste, so maybe increase the sweet ingredients"
581,9,"I like the smell of the product, the appearance looks very  natural  and the texture and flavor are very nice",5,"nice size, and not too crunchy and no weird aftertaste",more flavor
623,9,"I like the smell of the product, the appearance looks very  natural  and the texture and flavor are very nice",5,"it is a very nice sensory snack. good flavor, smell, texture, appearance",more flavor
802,9,"I like the smell of the product, the appearance looks very  natural  and the texture and flavor are very nice",5,Its not a difficult bar to bite into - its crunchy but its not a rock hard bar.,maybe increase the flavor a little bit
581,3,"The crunch, texture and size. I like the ingredients in it other then the BBQ",2,maybe i dont really know what my expecations were since a BBQ granola bar is as whole new concept to me. but in the end I think of my granola bars being sweet and a breakfast item rather than tangy and spicey,"I weoudl take out the BBQ, jsut stick with the honey, cinnamon type of flavors"
623,3,I like the crunch. I like the granola and nuts in it as well as the size of the product.,2,"I just think of sweet when i have a granola or poteien, energy or breakfast bar. So i as going in for something sweet and it was realy just too spcky for my liking in the bar form, it would be better as a snack mix",I really just dont like the BBQ flavor to be honest. It just seemed and odd combination  personally
802,4,The crunch is really good an the more you eat it the more you get used to it. It has a nice balance of sweet and savory and feels like it should be healthy,2,i just thought it would be a more mild bbq. I also expect granola bars to be sweet so it was taken off guard,it jsut personally dont like the BBQ it was too tangy and made and at all breakfasty which is when i like to eat my granola bars
581,9,"I really like the flavor and crunch, number 2/3 for me",5,"I had no clue what to expect, but this was really good!",I think a little less crunch would be good
623,8,"I like the crunch on this one and the flavor is very good, this is 3/3 for me",5,"I had no idea what to expect, but these are great!",I think there needs to be a bit more BBQ flavor on this one.
802,9,"I love the flavor and the texture, it's not too strong, but taste great, my favorite of the 3",5,"I was not sure what to expect, but I can see having a box of these in my office as a snack.",I would change nothing!
581,6,The BBQ flavor is there but is not too overpowering and you taste it more so as you eat it as opposed to it instantly hitting your tongue as soon as you bite it.,3,When I think of BBQ flavor this bar is the taste that I would expect with the exception of the it being a little too salty.,Not make is as salty.
623,3,It has a crunch but also some softness from the peanuts. The BBQ flavor is a little more mild.,2,The BBQ flavor is very strong and it leaves a salty flavor in my mouth.,I would not make it as salty.
802,3,"I like that it's small for on the go purposes, usually I am up for work around 5am and I like to grab granola bars on my way out the door to eat on my way to work. I also like the crunchy texture of the bar.",2,I do love BBQ flavors but this is not something that I would eat super early in the morning on my way to work as BBQ is not a flavor I crave for breakfast.,The BBQ flavor is very over powering and strong that it made me thirsty almost instantly.
581,4,The presentation,3,BBQ tastes good but not on or in everything,make the size slightly bigger
623,5,Just the appearance,2,it did not make my tastes buds tingle,I would add honey
802,6,The salty taste,3,smokey BBQ speaks for itself,adding honey
581,5,The bar tastes like many of the other Nature Valley bars I have had.  The taste has the consistency I like without having the awful aftertaste I sometimes get.,3,For a BBQ flavored product I find the consistency of the BBQ throughout to be perfect.,I would increase the secondary flavors to give it a deeper taste.
623,5,It has a consistent taste throughout that was not over the top.,3,The flavor was consistent and I like consistency vs over the top flavors,I think it’s needs more nuts
802,2,The tastes are not something I am looking for in a bar.,1,I do not want to have BBQ flavoring in a nature valley bar and this product confirms it.,I do not think anything can change it so I will like it.
581,5,It has a certain spice flavor like a chipotle flavor. Not much BBQ but I somewhat enjoy it. If the BBQ flavor was increased and was a bit more compact it would be good.,3,It was not my top 2 choices but once retried. The flavor was not terrible. I did not hold high expectations due to texture and appearance.,Increase the BBQ flavor and adjust the appearance.
623,4,I like the crunch more than the rest. Not sure what is different but it is a bit harder. It being compacted more possibly increases the crunch.,4,The appearance is better and the crunch is nice. Seems to be maybe more compacted. It was close to perfect minus additional flavor.,The taste should have more BBQ flavor. The appearance and crunch are great. Just not as satisfying in BBQ flavor.
802,7,"I feel with product 802 you can taste what is advertised. The BBQ flavor, richness, and crunch, are well-balanced but not overpowering. It is my first pick versus the other two product choices.",5,"As stated earlier, it is what I would expect it to taste like. The BBQ flavor is there and crunches from the nuts. The sweetness and salt combination.",If the appearance can be a bit more appealing. Unsure how the process is to do so. But it is not the most appealing. Until you try the product then I know I enjoy it.
581,1,this item has a unique taste and is very chalky.,2,Just not the taste for me,definitely add some sugar to it
623,2,nothing its very chalky,2,this product is just not something i would purchase. its very dry and chalky,i would like to add some sweet to it
802,2,the taste is kind of funny. it is a strong taste,3,"after tasting the product again, it does have a savory taste inn which i would no buy for this type of product",possibly add a sweeter taste to it
581,6,"little heat in the aftertaste, crunchy, not too hard",3,it was tasty and crunchy like a typical nature valley bar.  flavors were good and had nice texture,more smoke flavor...maybe a little heat
623,4,"smoky flavor, crunchy, feels like a healthy snack",2,"the flavor wasn't well developed and didn't overwhelm me, seemed like the flavor faded quickly","tasted a little  greasy , also the flavor seemed to fade almost immediately...not smoky aftertaste and no heat"
802,8,has a smoky aftertaste with a little heat.  lots of peanuts.,4,"it tasted pretty good, the flavors were well developed.  typically, I enjoy nature valley so I expected to enjoy this.","on one side, you can see nuts, etc.  But if you flip it over, it looks like it's just flattened.  Also, breaks very easily."
581,2,"Nothing.  I don’t like the taste at all.  It’s not tasty at all.  I don’t taste bbq, but something like Smokey.  It’s not appetizing at all.",3,"It didn’t sound good, and it didn’t taste good at all.","Everything.  I don’t like the taste.  The texture isn’t bad, but I can’t get over the taste."
623,2,I don’t like the taste at all.  There not much taste to it but something Smokey.  Not liking that.  There’s not an overwhelming bbq taste.,3,I didn’t think it was going to taste very good and it didn’t.,Everything.  I don’t like the taste at all.  The appearance isn’t too bad.  It’s just not very tasty.
802,2,I don’t like the Smokey taste of the product.  In my mind I was thinking I was going to eat a granola bar so I was expecting sweet but that’s not what I got.  The taste is not good at all.,2,"I guess if you like bbq it might not be bad, but I don’t like the taste at all.  I expected something that tasted different.  Not sure what, but not this…",Everything.  I don’t like the taste or the appearance.  Yucky…
581,4,Nothing,2,I thought it would taste like the other bars but the flavor was off,"The taste, the texture"
623,6,The flavor,3,I expected it to be crunchy and savory and it was,I would make it less crunchy
802,5,The flavor,3,The title explains the bar really well it is savory and crunchy.,A little less crunchy
581,8,I like the texture and the flavor of the bar.,3,The flavor is what I would expect from a bbq flavored bar.,"The first bite is a little strong, if that was a little milder I think it would be better."
623,7,I like the texture and the flavor is a good balance of savory and sweet,4,"The bbq flavor is there, but it’s not overbearing so it still feels like a healthy snack and not chips","I think the after taste is a little strong, maybe make that a little milder"
802,4,I like the crunchiness of the product,4,"I didn’t expect the product to be good at all, but it was surprisingly tasty",The taste is a little to strong for me
581,8,I like how well so much crunchy ness is packed into such a small bar,4,I thought it would be hard and plain with slight bbq flavor and I was wrong,I would maybe add cashews
623,9,Is taste good and have a pleasant crunch to each bite.,4,Good size and color. The other reason is because it has good flavor,Add cashews
802,8,The flavor of the smoky bbq is delicious. The texture is nice and crunchy,5,I thought it would be plain. But is turned out to be amazing,Nothing
581,8,I like the bbq  flavor.,4,The bar tastes good.,I would add more nuts.
623,9,I like that the bar I'd crunchy.,5,The bar is crunchy.,I wouldn't change nothing.
802,8,I like that the bar is crunchy.,4,The bar is tasty and crunchy.,I would put less salt.
581,8,It has the right amount of BBQ and spiciness and the right amount of tang.,4,It has the right amount of BBQ and spice I did not expect.,Less crunchy.
623,7,I like the mild BBQ and spicy flavor and it has some tang.,3,It had the amount of spice and BBQ as expected.,A bit more BBQ and spice and more tang. Less crunchy.
802,7,I like the BBQ and mild spice and also the slight tang.,3,I thought it would be mild as far as spice and BBQ go.,"Make it more BBQ and more spicy, less crunchy."
581,6,I like that the peanut flavor is mixed with the BBQ flavor. And the BBQ flavor is not too overwhelming.,3,This is what I expect the bar to taste like.,The BBQ taste is a little more tangy than sweet.
623,4,The flavor of the BBQ is pretty strong. I'm not liking it as much as I thought I would.,2,I thought it would be more of a mix of flavors. It is pretty much all BBQ flavor.,Lessen the amount of the BBQ flavor
802,6,I like the chunks of peanuts in the bar and the tangy bbq flavor.,3,The flavor of the peanuts mixes with granola was what I expected. Also knowing it was BBQ flavored I expected that taste.,It does seem to break apart very easily.
581,7,good bbq taste,3,I like it,I like it
623,4,too smoky,2,I am not a fan of the taste or the after taste,less bbq smoky taste
802,5,crunchy,3,I was a fan of the smoky bbq flavor,too smoky
581,9,The flavor is like nothing I've ever tasted before,5,The nature Valley product just seems to keep getting better than ever. The balance is perfect,Nothing at all
623,9,The balance of flavors,5,I've tried others and this flavor profile is very unique,Nothing. Like it just as is
802,8,It's surprisingly burst of flavors,5,I like all of the nature Valley product. This one is very different than any other product like this,Nothing. I would definitely buy this product
581,7,"I like the BBQ flavor with the peanuts, and the texture",3,This is my third sample of the same flavor so I know what to expect.,It still has too much aftertaste and I don't have any craving to continue eating it.
623,7,I like the BBQ flavor combined with peanuts.,3,Second sample so I had a better idea of how this would taste,"I think it's giving too much of an aftertaste, not making me want to eat any more of it because the flavor is a little too much."
802,8,"I love the BBQ flavor with peanuts, also really like how you can taste the smoky flavor and a little bit of sweetness but not too much.",4,"I wasn't sure how BBQ bar would taste, I normally associate these types of products with breakfast",Maybe less peanuts
581,7,strong flavor,4,tastes better than it looks,nothing maybe bigger
623,7,the savory flavor,4,dont normally like bbq but this is good,make bigger
802,8,i like the smokey flavor and its crunchy,4,it had more flavor than i expected,bigger
581,8,I like the flavor of this product.  It's smoky bbq but not too strong and has a hint of sweetness to it.,4,I thought it would have a weird bbq flavor to it but it does not.,"Have pieces of the peanuts visable, the only seeds/nuts I could see while looking at it were sunflower seeds."
623,8,A hint of sweet.  I like the crunch mixed with the seed and nut flavor.,4,I was expecting an overbearing bbq flavor.  This one is subtle.,Make it not quite so crumbly.  This one made a big mess each bite I took.
802,9,"That you can see the seeds/nuts.  The crunch is great, not too hard to bite through.  You can taste a hint of the bbq flavor, it is not overpowering.",3,Its just as I imagined a bar of this name would taste.,Nothing to change in my opinion.
581,6,I liked the texture a lot. It was crunchy but not crumbly. The barbeque flavor was pleasant but weaker than I had hoped. The same for the smoky flavor. The aftertaste was present but not bad.,2,I expected something much more flavorful and not as bland. Other snack bars typically border on being almost too strong but this ones flavor definitely needed to be boosted a bit.,I would increase the amount of barbeque flavor and smoky flavor. This product did not have as strong of a peanut flavor so the barbeque flavor wasnt overpowered it was simply too weak. I otherwise really enjoyed this product but would not buy it due to the weakness of the flavor.
623,4,I like the barbeque flavors of this product and I enjoy the texture of this product.,2,I expected a bar that really accentuated the barbeque and smoky flavors and this bar did not do that for me at all.,The barbeque flavor is good but is very minimal. The smoky flavor of the previous bar is also not very strong. The peanut taste almost overpowers the barbeque flavors and makes the bar taste somewhat bland. The aftertaste is ok but this one seems to have something slightly spicier in it that I did not care for.
802,8,I like that the smoky flavor and the barbeque flavor really stand out against the peanut taste. The peanut taste is faint and does not overpower or hinder the barbeque flavor at all. The texture is nice and there is little to no aftertaste.,5,The moment I took a bite I was able to immediately notice the barbeque flavors and the smoky flavors in the bar. It did not taste bland or strange in any way.,There is not much that I can think of to change this product for the better. The physical appearance of the bar is fairly normal and boring when compared to the sweeter bars with chocolate and such in them but it is to be expected given the flavor of this bar and dont feel like it detracts from the enjoyment.
581,9,"It tastes like Lay's BBQ chips, but in a form of a delicious nut bar with better, crunchier texture of a nut bar.",5,"A savory nut bar is a new concept to me, and I had preconceived notions that BBQ-flavored nut bars wouldn't be tasty. This was a pleasant surprise.",Nothing - both flavor and texture were excellent.
623,7,"I like its savory taste and texture, though the taste doesn't stand out like the other bars.",4,"This is in line with the other bars: I didn't expect a savory taste to go so well with a nut bar, but it does.","I'm unsure how I'd change it to make this product better. It's a good product on its own, just doesn't stand out as much to me."
802,9,The flavor and the texture make this a perfect savory snack for me.,5,I didn't expect the taste to compliment the composition and the texture of the nut bar so well.,Nothing. It's delicious.
581,7,I like the smokey flavor.,4,I didn't think they could make a bar that was savory and make me want to keep eating it.,"I don't like the texture very much, it seems very brittle and kind of hard to bite."
623,7,The look of it.,3,"It tastes how I think it would. Not great, but not bad.",It is too dense and lacks as much flavor.
802,8,I like the light crisp crunch and the tang of flavor.,5,I like how the flavor snapped and it was crispy yet crunchy.,I wouldn't really change anything.
581,4,I do not like the barbeque flavoring.  It does not go well with the nutty crunchiness of the bar.,2,"I like BBQ chips so I thought I'd like this, however I don't.  The flavor is too strong and doesn't fit in this combination with nuts.",Make the flavoring much less noticeable.
623,3,The barbecue taste is a little too tangy.,3,The other samples tasted very similar so I expected this bar to taste this way.,Reduce the flavor.
802,4,I'm not a fan of the Barbeque flavor.  It's a bit too strong and doesn't go well with nuts.,3,The previous sample had a nearly identical taste so I expected the same with this bar.,Reduce the flavoring.
581,3,Too salty and smoky,2,I underestimated how much the BBQ would throw off the balance. When partaking in a Nature Valley Bar you do t expect to receive a taste liking to Barbecue chips,Decrease the BBQ flavoring  Add an additional element like another nut
623,7,This is a better combination of the ingredients and the best one so far,3,This meet my expectations exactly,Something to add to the texture   An additional ingredient or nut
802,4,Still too much BBQ flavor. It is better and not as salty but still over powers everything else.,3,This taste is closer to what I was expecting when thinking of a bbq crunch bar,Mute the BBQ flavor just a smidge
581,6,crunchy and nutty  peanuts are good,3,"I tasted BBQ, nuts and seeds",tastes a little too spicy BBQ
623,7,crunchy and salty.   has a nutty taste.,3,it was satisfying.  a nice texture and salty taste,make it more nutty
802,7,"It is crunchy, nutty and salty.   a nice touch of BBQ flavor",3,expected it to have nuts and a bbq flavor and it did,its good as is
581,3,Its perfect crunchy level. Not too crunchy,4,I wasn’t expecting it to taste good because of the odd combination.,"Perhaps try a different style of bbq, like hickory style"
623,3,Again. Just an odd flavor that isn’t for me,4,"It’s just a odd, unique flavor. I wasn’t expecting it to be delicious",Perhaps try a different BBQ type besides smoky
802,3,"Its consistent with other nature valley bars. A crunchy but fresh taste, despite not loving the flavor",4,Didn’t have high expectations for a smoky barbecue flavor but its Nature Valley quality,"Try something besides smoky, maybe honey bbq"
581,3,the nuts and seeds and seems somewhat healthy. It has a good crunch,2,It is not like a bbq chip and the flavor just didn't seem to go well with the mouth feel,I'm not a fan of the bbq flavor. it kind of clashes for what I like it a bar
623,6,the taste is the best of the 3. the crunch and contents are good,3,it was ok. had a decent bbq flavor and wasn't overpowering,not a fan of the bbq flavor. it is confusing taste with the texture. The cheese may be better
802,5,"good crunch, has some healthy ingredients",2,it just wasn't a good flavor or taste to me. It was a conflicting taste mixture and texture,not a fan of the bbq flavor but it was better than the first one
581,3,It has a nice crunch. I like the smokey taste,2,I can taste the bbq flavor but I think the savoriness needs to be ramped up with a touch more salt. It's almost too sweet to be savory,I think it needs a tad more salt.
623,4,"The crunch is firm, the smokiness is nice. The flavors from the nuts comes through",2,"It does taste like bbq and leans more towards savory, but I think the bbq flavor could be more obvious and be more savory.",The bbq flavor is a bit muddled. There needs to be more smoke and a tad more salt.
802,7,"The bbq flavor is very clear and obvious. I wish there was a tad bit more salt but the bbq flavor is very obvious, which I love. Less sweetness, which helps this bar taste more savory",3,"It actually fell below my expectations every so slightly, but it's close enough to being acceptable. The bbq flavor is clear, it's clearly a savory snack, and the crunch is firm and delicious.","It just needs a tiny bit more salt. A little tartness would brighten up the flavor, too."
581,9,"I've never had a BBQ style nature valley bar. It's completely unique compared to other products of this type. I'm surprised how well it worked. The prominent ingredients I sense are the roasted peanuts, the sunflower seeds, and almonds, and I love those. The BBQ flavor and aftertaste I wonderful and really set it apart.",5,"I had no idea what I BBQ flavor Nature valley bar would taste like, because I normally buy their basic flavors. I wasn't sure if it would work, but it really does!",Nothing really. I already want to buy a box.
623,9,"It's a very BBQ tasting Nature Valley bar. I never expected the combination of roasted peanuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, topped off with BBQ flavoring to work so well in bar form. It tastes really good, which is the deal maker.",5,"I didn't expect a BBQ flavored Nature Valley Bar to work as well as this one does. I expected it to be overdone in the flavor department, but it isn't All the ingredients are perfectly balanced.",I wouldn't change anything.
802,8,"The newness it offers in comparison to the rest of the market. I didn't think BBQ flavored Nature Valley Bars would work, but they totally do. It tastes great, the sunflower seeds and roasted peanuts are prominent, and all ingredients compliment each other.",5,I wasn't sure how Nature valley would create a bar with any sort of spice work well as much as this one did.,Nothing. It works fine as is.
581,3,I like the crunch of the bar. That's about it.,2,This bar was below my expectations because the BBQ flavor was too overpowering. I like BBQ but the flavor on this was too strong for me.,The BBQ taste is way too strong for me. It reminds me too much of Lay's BBQ chips and the taste is overpowering. This one doesn't give off a healthy vibe to me because of the overpowering BBQ flavor.
623,8,The flavor of the BBQ is perfect on this. Not too strong or too weak. The crunch is perfect as well.,4,"I wasn't sure what to expect going into trying these. Overall the 2 I like including this one exceeded my expectations. This 1 tasted great, had a nice crunch to it and was filling.",Make the bar a little larger. Other than that I wouldn't change anything except maybe load it with some more protein to make it more enticing to gym goers.
802,8,I like the crunchiness and the the taste of the BBQ. It's not as overpowering as the previous one. It has a nice smokiness to it as well.,4,I wasn't sure what to expect especially after tasting the 1st bar. This was exceeded my expectations and would be great as a snack on the go. I probably would not eat it at breakfast time because of the BBQ flavor but it would be great at lunch or as a snack on the go.,Make the bar a little larger. Other than that I wouldn't change anything except maybe load it with some more protein to make it more enticing to gym goers.
581,6,"It is an interesting flavor that I was not expecting.  Once I got over my initial shock, I can see where I would crave the savory, saltiness of it.",4,Good taste and crunch.,Maybe a little thicker?  Make the color more appealing
623,6,Good crunch and flavor,3,Seems like a smoky bbq bar should be,Tastes a little too smoky - almost burnt
802,6,"BBQ taste, crunch",3,Very much what a bbq bar would be expected to feel,Nothing
581,4,its healthy,2,because i thought it would taste better,i would make it taste better
623,5,its also healthy as well,2,it was okay and better than the rest,make it have sweeter taste
802,4,its healthy as well,2,because it tastes whack,i would make it tastier
581,4,"I like bars, so that is what i like about it, its genre",2,"I think I was just optimistic about the taste, but the actually taste compared to any bar that I have had is too unique",Not so spicy
623,6,I like the taste slightly,4,"Tasting the other test products, this taste the best, and I expected not to like it",It taste like it's supposed to
802,3,I don't really like it,2,It doesn't have a savory taste,Make it sweeter
581,8,"It's tasty- it has a slight nutty sweetness along side the salty savoriness of the rest of the bar, and a slight spicy kick to it.",5,"It embodies everything that's used to describe it. It's nutty and savory, and the BBQ flavor is highly discernible.","I personally would up the spiciness just a tad, but I understand that may not appeal to the majority of consumers."
623,8,"It's very satisfying when you want a crunchy, salty snack with a little spice and wholesome peanut and seed ingredient.",5,I didn't know what to expect but this is something I'd definitely like to have more of so I'm now a fan who would seek it out.,"I prefer a smokier, spicier taste. Not too overwhelming, but a good BBQ flavor."
802,9,It's really savory and you can really taste the salty and sweet peanuts. I like the smoky BBQ flavor that overlays it as well.,5,"I expected it to be sweeter than it was, like most granola bars, but was pleasantly surprised at what a good salty snack option it turned out to be.","I would probably make it have an even stronger smoky barbecue flavor, just a bit more intense."
581,8,"has a nice crunch, is not too hard, tastes really good",4,I think it tasted good based on my expectations,ground the nuts and such in a little more so they are not so big.
623,9,"I think this is the best bar out of the three. Between looks, taste and crunch its perfect.",5,Its a great tasting bar.,Nothing
802,2,Its way too hard to bite,2,My first impression of taking the first bite really made me think of the worst,make ti softer to bite
581,8,"The savory BBQ flavor, just enough salt and hit of spice.  This bar wasnt as crumbly as the other two.  I like that you can tell what grain is what (whole grains)",3,It tastes like BBQ sauce.  so that's what I expected,I would like for it to have a touch of sweetness and more spice
623,4,"Not as crumbly, you can see the whole grains, has a nice spice to it but would like more spice.",2,It almost has no flavor IMO.  Too much smoke flavor and not enough BBQ sauce flavor,"It has too much smoke flavor, not enough BBQ sauce flavor and not sweet at all"
802,7,"Not too much of a smoky flavor, you can see the whole grains, and it's not as crumbly as most Nature Valley bars",3,It has whole grains and is crunchy like the other NV bars I have tried,"It needs to be sweeter, I don't taste BBQ sauce as much, and it needs a little bit of spice"
581,8,This sample has a smoky BBQ taste with a hint of sweetness. It's also crunchy and the flavor stays in your mouth a bit after swallowing the product.,5,"I didn't expect a savory flavor to work for a snack bar. Yet, surprisingly, it did.",I'd make the BBQ smoky flavor a bit stronger.
623,2,"The only things I like about this product are the crunchiness, appearance, and the healthy ingredients.",1,I can barely taste the BBQ flavoring. It seems like it's more like a peanuts only taste.,The BBQ flavoring needs to be increased greatly. I can barely taste it in this sample. I can taste the peanuts almost exclusively.
802,7,This sample taste more savory than the first sample. I can taste more of the BBQ flavoring.,4,"This sample had the right combination of nuts, savory flavor, and saltiness,",I wouldn't change anything about this sample.
581,4,I like the textures and the amounts of nuts and seeds. I also think that it has a good amount of crunch.,3,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect with this flavor. It's something new and different, so it was about what I expected.","I think it might be better if there was a bit more sweetness to it; maybe more like a honey-barbecue flavor. I like barbecue, but I don't love this flavor of barbecue."
623,6,I like the nuts and seeds in the product. I like the amount of crunch. I also like how this one has a bit more sweetness than the others.,3,"It's a savory bar, and since I haven't ever had something like this before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.",I think I'd dial back the smoky flavor but still keep the barbecue flavor. I would also increase the nuts and seeds in the bar.
802,4,"I like the nuts and seeds, and I like the crunch. I like that it's an option for a savory bar because that's a unique product.",3,"Since this is a unique bar, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.","I think it might be better if there was a bit more sweetness to it; maybe more like a honey-barbecue flavor. I like barbecue, but I don't love this flavor of barbecue.I think this particular bar could use more nuts and seeds."
581,8,"I like the tangy BBQ flavor, great crunch, and satisfying savory nut flavor",4,"The BBQ flavor is good and not too overpowering, texture is similar to other nature valler bars",A little less crumbly and messy
623,8,"Great texture and crunch, nice BBQ flavor too tangy",4,The BBQ flavor works well with the peanuts,Maybe a larger size?
802,6,I like the savory flavor,3,"It tastes lile BBQ nut, nothing spectacular","It gets stuck in my teeth, more pronounced BBQ flavor preferred"
581,2,I do not like the flavor or this product.  It tastes artificial.,1,I thought I would enjoy the flavor more.,I think the seasoning blend needs to be tweaked to taste natural.
623,2,I did not like the taste at all.  Something is off.,2,The seasoning is off.,The flavor needs improvement
802,2,The product has a bitter taste.  I cant put my finger on it but it does not taste like bbq.,2,I thought the product would taste better.,The seasoning blend needs to be fixed.
581,4,"It crumbles each bite and falls apart. It's really smoky flavor, which comes off a little bitter.",2,"I figured it would be smokey, but it is a bit too much. And really messy, when this type of bar could be good on the go - but because messy not good for that.",Less crumbly and less smokey. Maybe a hint of sweetness to take smokey away.
623,8,"Perfectly crunchy, doesn't fall apart when you eat, flavor is delicious. Perfect size.",5,"The flavor is so good, not too much roasted. It stays together when you bite it. It's smokey BBQ but not too much of anything.","Nothing honestly, this one is my favorite."
802,8,"It tastes really good. It's clean, smokey but not too much. BBQ flavor is really good.",4,It's really flavorful and fun and different. I'd def snack on this or eat with a lunch. I'd take on on the go.,Not much I think it's really good.
581,8,"I like the upfront BBQ flavor, but also tasting the  rest of the components of snack as well.",3,"As stated before, it is a pretty good balance of the BBQ to the nuttiness of the bar itself","dial back the BBQ flavor just a bit, cause it sticks with you in your mouth for quite a while afterward"
623,7,"The BBQ isn't overpowering, but is a little weak at the same time",2,"The other two were much more there, this one not as much",Give it a little more BBQ punch
802,7,I like the fact that the BBQ flavor isn't as strong as 581 and that the peanut flavor comes out more,4,It has good balance with very like after taste.,"Make it bigger, flavor is spot on."
581,9,I love how the savory sweetness of the bar is immediately reinforced by the unique peanut flavor and then rounded out by the smoky BBQ flavor!  So delicious and I can't believe it's wholesome and healthy!,5,"When I was imagining smoky BBQ, savory and sweet, etc. this bar exceeded those expectations!  The strongest positive is the great balance of savory and sweet with the smoky BBQ bringing everything together as I ate the bar.","I would not change ANYTHING at all about this bar because all of the flavors, as well as the texture, are perfect!  It's crunchy but not to the extent where it is tough to eat as some bars may be."
623,8,"This bar has a good savory taste to it and the smoky BBQ flavor really comes through well, especially at the back of my throat and into my nose so it smells enticing.  There's also a nice taste to it that has a hint of sweet but more salty and savory.",3,This is about what I would expect from tasting other foods that are BBQ-flavored.  It's not very memorable and is not forgettable; definitely recognizable in taste.,I think it's just a preference but I would like more peanut and sweet integrated.  The sweet is dulled and the smoky BBQ is a bit overpowering the longer it lingers.
802,7,I like the peanut taste and the smoky BBQ flavor. The bar is also crunchy but not too much so.  There's also a sweetness to it.,2,It tastes like separate ingredients were placed in one bar but the mixture of ingredients don't quite gel.  There's no harmony in the flavors.,I would make the salty/savory aspect a little more present; it's missing.
581,1,Doesn’t taste good,1,I didn’t like the overwhelming taste,Taste less strong
623,3,Not as flavorful as the others - not as overwhelming,3,Was more like what I expected- slight sweetness with saltiness,Add little bit of sweetness
802,1,Nothing,1,I didn’t like the taste,Less flavorful
581,9,I love how crispy and tasteful the nuts are.  I like how the taste is not overpowering and I'm still able to get the taste of the peanuts.   The chewy sweet and salty granola bar satisfies all my taste buds. And one simply isn't enough. Affordable and individually packaged so it makes it perfect to throw in your purse or a lunch box.,5,"I felt that I would not like it based on the BBQ, but I was wrong.",Nothing
623,9,"I love the overall taste and texture of this product, the BBQ compliments the salty well",5,I had felt like it was not going to be good due to the name but it was very well,Nothing
802,9,It taste amazing and the BBQ goes great with the sweet and salty,5,My reason for the rating is because I really did not think it would taste good but I was very wrong,Nothing
581,9,It has a light smoky flavor which is nice. I love the crunch and portion size is great.,5,I liked the bbq flavor. I love the crunch and it was as I was hoping the bar to be.,I'd like a little more of a bbq flavor.
623,9,"It has a great smoky bbq flavor. I love crunchy things and this has an amazing crunch. Size is good - not too big, not too small.",5,"I don't always love bbq flavored things, because sometimes it's too tangy. This was great with the smoky flavor to it. Definitely better than I thought it was going to be.",Nothing. I would buy and enjoy it just as.
802,9,I like the bbq flavor. I like the crunch and size. I like the nuts and seeds in it as well.,5,"It is a great bar. Generally, bars are sweeter than savory. It's nice to have an option for a savory snack bar that isn't a meat stick/","This bar, perhaps by design or incident, didn't have quite the 'snap' to it when I broke a piece off. If by design, I do prefer the other bars better with a seemingly extra crunch to it."
581,6,Good peanut flavor,4,Nice crunch,Less BBQ smoke
623,2,Too spicy,1,Nothing savory about the spice,More peanut
802,6,Good peanut flavor,3,Wholesome,More salt
581,8,I love the crunchiness and lingering taste.,5,Prior to tasting any of the 3 samples I had a few reservations. But upon tasting this product it does seem like a product I'd love consuming on the regular.,I have no changes to suggest for this product.
623,8,I love the flavor and lingering taste. I can taste the hint of bbq but the peanut butter ( I assume) is what's really leaving a lingering taste.,5,It was a new flavor. I was reserved by what it may taste like but upon the first bite I was elated.,Nothing comes to mind for a change for this product.
802,8,This one was my favorite out of the 3 samples. I love have the taste melds together and the aftertaste is a bit more settled than with the other two.,5,I was skeptical but quickly sated upon tasting this product. It blends to well together it left me wanting to eat the entire sample.,I cannot think of anything I would change with this sample.
581,7,"I like the flavor of the BBQ and the crunchiness of the bar.  The bigger size of the peanuts was good, too.",4,It met my expectations with the flavor and the crunch of the bar.  I was pleased with the bolder flavor!,"I would lessen the amount of salt taste (it was more of a quick salt taste when I first bit into it).  I would also change the part when you broke off a piece, the peanuts crumbled off separately.  I would add a bit more of the BBQ flavor too."
623,8,"I like the hint of sweetness of this product and the hint of BBQ flavor.  I tasted the seeds in it and liked the crunch of each part of the bar.  There was minimal salty taste, which was good.  I liked how the product reminded me of eating BBQ flavored potato chips, but it wasn't chips at all!  Delicious!",4,I was pleased that the product actually tasted better than expected.  It was a mixture of eating sweet granola products and BBQ chips- a combination that is new.,"I would change the amount of small pieces that fell off when breaking off a piece to eat. I would also add a tiny bit more of a sweet flavor to this product.  Looking at the bar, I would like bigger pieces of peanuts too."
802,7,I like the hardness and crunchiness of the bar.  There was an aftertaste of BBQ that lasted- I liked that very much.  I also like the color of the bar- brighter to let me know that it was going to be a BBQ flavor.,2,I didn't expect the bold taste of salt.  I expected the BBQ flavor to come out more- maybe even a bold BBQ taste rather than a salt taste.,There was a taste of salt that lingered in my mouth- this was too much.  I'd change that so it doesn't linger and so it isn't a bold taste of salt.  Maybe change it to have more of a sea salt taste than a regular salt taste.
581,9,Unique taste but not overpowering. Savory but not too salty. Inviting appearance.,5,"When I heard the idea, I was not initially excited to try it but more intrigued to see how you would put it together. you exceeded my expectations by far! Delicious & attractive!",I truly cannot think of anything!
623,9,The crunch & delightful savory BBQ flavor. Great textures but not heavy. It's a refreshing change of pace!,5,I was unsure about making a granola bar savory but you have done an amazing job in balancing wholesome goodness I have cone to love with Nature Valley products with a fresh new savory twist!,Nothing
802,9,It seems to have a more uniform look and the coloration is just slightly lighter than the last one. It is attractive and appealing!,5,I did not know what to expect but you knocked it out of the park! It is unique and delicious and savory but not too salty. I am sold!,I cannot think of any changes. I like it!
581,8,like the crunchiness of the bar and the flavor. it's unique and would satisfy a craving,3,it matches the description and fits well with nature valley,add more whole nuts
623,4,i like the crunch of the bar,2,the flavor is too strong,the flavor is strong and a bit overpowering. i'd reduce the flavor strength a bit
802,7,i like the savoriness of the bar. it's very craveable,3,matches well with the previous product description,make the smoky bbq flavor a tad less strong
581,8,"unique for a granola bar, tasty & crunchy",5,had no expectations since it was such a unique idea,"nothing really, maybe less sugar"
623,8,"unique for a granola bar, tasty & crunchy",5,I just didn't know what to expect since it was so new I didn't really have expectations!,"not much, maybe slightly less sweet"
802,8,Unique product,5,Didn't have expectations!,Nothing
581,3,I like that it is crunchy and salty,3,Thought it would taste odd and it did,NO BBQ FLAVOR
623,2,Nothing,3,I thought it would taste weird and I was right.,Not make it bbq flavor
802,2,Nothing,2,It tasted worse than the others,No bbq flavor
581,6,Crunchy,2,Does not have enough flavoring,Needs a little more flavor
623,6,It has a slight BBQ  taste,2,Taste  like it could have used slightly more of a  BBQ flavor,It could  have a little bit more of a BBQ  taste
802,4,Crunchiness,2,expected more of a BBQ taste,Add a Bit more flavor
581,7,The crunch is great. Nice nuttiness to it and it’s slightly Smokey and sweet. Good balance,5,Good after taste that lingers and no dryness after.,Probably make it a little bigger
623,6,It’s crunchy and has a little sweetness to it. I like the nuttiness and savory flavors,4,It’s wholesome and nutty. Didn’t expect quality ingredients,It is super dry once you finish the bite.
802,4,Good flavor. Subtle smokiness,2,Good flavor. The bar is too hard,Too crunch and hard
581,4,The nuts,1,"Like i said before, taste like dog food.  It was also to thick for my taste.  The nut amount was good.  BBQ  flavor a bit lacking also in this one.","My first thought was it taste like a bog biscuit.  There was not much BBQ taste but that was not the big thing for me.  As to what you could do, i am not that much of a cook so???"
623,7,It has a good peanut crunch and i love seeds.  The flavor is not overpowering with the BBQ and has a slightly spicy but not to much flavor.,5,"When i saw they were BBQ i expected a lot more BBQ flavor, which in a bar i didn't think was a good thing,  This is the right amount for a salty bar","with the BBQ flavor i can not really see what you could do to make it better.  More sunflower seed for me, but not everyone would like that."
802,7,"It is not to thick. I like the more peanut and nuts taste with the hint of BBQ, but not to much of it",5,"I was figuring the BBQ would be overpowering, but it is not.  Not to salty but nice nut flavor","Actually not much.  I would like more sunflower seeds, but that's just me"
581,8,"Smoky flavor, not too salty, made of nuts, tastes healthy-ish",3,"This product was not quite as good as 623 or 802, but I still liked it a lot. I would say it met my expectations","Less crumbly, a little bit less hard"
623,8,"Great smoky flavor, doesn't taste too salty, heavy on the peanut flavor, product is a good size",4,I liked this product more than I thought I would - I think Nature Valley really nailed the smoky flavor,Make it stay together so there are not so many crumbs! It's the same thing I hate about the Nature Valley bars currently on the market
802,8,"Smoky flavor, not too salty, nice crunch, seems healthy-ish",4,I quite liked this product. I think it had the best texture of the three and the taste was on par with the other two as well. Very tasty and better than I though a product like this would be,"Less crumbly, more of a cohesive texture that stays together (like a clif bar)"
581,6,not as bold with the smokey flavor,4,wasnt overbearing with the smokey,a little more sweetness
623,7,crunchy and wholesome,5,you dont think of smokey with nature valley bar but they totally captured the taste,too smokey for me
802,8,this one had a good blend of smokey and a little sweet,5,considering the first two bars i thought this one would have been overly sweet with no smokey,nothing
581,5,it's certainly  a little more mellow than the first one I tried but i think that also makes it not as memorable for me.,3,I expected it to be similar to the previous one but at the same time just more mild which isn't a bad thing but it doesn't make me want more than the previous.,the flavor should be a bit more intense and noticeable than it is.
623,8,"a rather nice burst of misquite flavoring, slightly smokey, but savory the way beef jerky would be",5,I think the notion of a savory BBQ bar sounded really at home with the flavors and style i feel nature valley is known for with their products.,i like the crunchiness but it's almost too close to the consistency of a cookie.
802,8,"I think it has a great balance between sweet and savory, which I didn't think you could do in bar form but works very well here.",5,"After the second one was rather in the middle, i didn't anticipate this being a leap ahead of that and the flavor just pop much more immediately and lingered longer than the second bar I tried.",Nothing
581,2,The nutty flavor of the product is overwhelming. Maybe its what they were going for but it kinda just tastes like BBQ chip flavored peanuts. I am not a fan.,2,I did not think I would like these bars because I'm not a huge fan of BBQ flavored food (other than actual BBQ) in general. These were even worse than I imagined though because of the nutty flavors and texture.,Texture was alright on this one but I did not like the heavy nutty flavor.
623,1,I do not like anything about this product. The texture is weird and undesirable - like it's not crunchy enough or something. The BBQ flavor is very uninspired. The whole concept is confusing to me.,2,I am not typically a huge fan of BBQ flavored things (other than actual BBQ) so I was disappointed but not surprised that the flavor was pretty bad.,Change the texture to be more crispy. Change the flavor to be less faux BBQ and something more interesting.
802,2,The texture is fine but there's not much else I enjoy about it.,1,I was prepared to dislike these bars based on the BBQ flavor alone. I did not think I would like these bars because I'm not a huge fan of BBQ flavored food (other than actual BBQ). These were even worse than I imagined though because of the extreme nut flavor to this bar.,Definitely tone down the peanut flavor. It is extreme in this bar compared to the others.
581,9,It's a perfect blend between sweet and salty.,5,I freaking loooovvveee it!!! I can't wait to buy,nothing
623,8,I love BBQ favor. It's bold and it's different from any bar I've had.,5,I honestly didn't think I would enjoy it in that form of a snack but it was yummy.,nothing. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
802,3,I didn't enjoy the flavors.,2,The flavor didn't meet the other bars.,The flavors could be better.
581,8,I like that it was little bit sweet and savory. It also tasted healthy and just had a slight bbq taste.,4,"I wasn't sure what a savory bbq bar would taste like. However, it was pretty good!",I would make it thicker.
623,8,It had a good smoky bbq flavor and the crunch of the bar.,4,I wasn't sure how well I would like a savory bar but it hit all of the flavor profiles I hoped it would.,I would make it thicker.
802,7,I thought this one had more seeds than the others and a good barbecue flavor.,4,I wasn’t sure how well barbecue would fit in with the savory and sweet mix but I thought it was great. It met and exceeded my expectations.,I would make the product a bit thicker.
581,6,I like that I can see all the ingredients,2,Its lacking the BBQ flavor its more of a nutty flavor,Add more smoky bbq flavor and make it not so hard to bite into
623,7,I like that I can see all the ingredients it smells appetizing I like the saltiness and there is a hint of sweetness,3,It fits the description nothing fantastic or terrible its a good bar,It is way too hard to bite into and needs more smokey flavor
802,6,I like the crunch and different textures and the hint of BBQ,3,ITs only a hint of BBQ I would add more flavor,I would add more smokiness and BBQ
581,3,There is a bit of a better bbq taste in it. I like the sweet and sour taste as well,2,I was expecting a better product that made me want to eat more- somehow this doesn't blend well together and i cant see myself eating it again,the taste just doesnt seem to blend together well enough to make it something worth buying.
623,2,"Its difficult to tell what the taste is. And it doesn't come across in a positive way. It also had an odd texture compared to other Nature Valley bars I have eaten in the past, along with a weird aftertaste.  I had a frown on my face while eating it :(",1,I was expecting a sweet honey bbq flavor kind of taste. I didn't taste anything sweet or good in it.,"I thought BBQ flavor would taste good, but it doesn't seem to go well with the bar. Not sure how you can improve this..sorry to say."
802,4,"its got a good sweet sour balance. Other than that, not much else",2,The taste just doesnt go well together.,its got a salty after taste. Also has a smokey taste that tastes artificial. also a bit to hard
581,7,The appearance of the color looks like how BBQ should kind of orangy and tangy looking,4,I pictured it to look less BBQ flavored like the last sample,Nothing I can think of yet
623,6,It has a BBQ flavor but slightly too light for me I like bold BBQ taste,4,I wasn't sure how bbq nature Valley would taste i pictured something gross to be honest,Stronger BBQ taste for sure
802,9,The look is exactly what I would picture a BBQ bar to look like,5,I love the flavor it is subtle but still leaves a nice BBQ after taste which surprises me because I wanted bold flavor,Nothing as far as appearance
581,6,The crunch.  It's less orange as 623.  I like that it's not overly nutty.,3,I kinds of expected it to be on the sweeter side since most of the bars are sweet.,"It's a little sweet for me.  623 wasn't as sweet, if I am eating something savory I want more of the savory and less of the sweet."
623,7,This one is not as sweet as 581. It's got a nice balance of nuts to oats.,4,"Smoky is apt. It's definitely got that smokey BBQ flavor.  I wasn't sure how that would go with oats, but it's quite good.","I would love to see how it would taste with almonds or cashews.  Peanuts are probably my least favorite nut.  Still good, but not my fav."
802,7,I like the BBQ flavor.  Feels balanced like 623 but not quite as smoky.,4,I always think something is going to be too sweet for my preference.  This was surprisingly not super sweet and I enjoyed that.,This one had more peanut flavor.  I think I would prefer less peanut flavor.  Maybe a different nut that's not as strong so that the BBQ shines more.
581,9,"The size,taste,texture,ingredients",3,I am always looking for something new to try,I would not change anything
623,9,"The taste,texture,size ingredients",3,I am always looking for something new to try,Just leave it as it is
802,9,"The scent,taste,texture",3,I already have started to love this product,I would not change anything
581,8,"Good smoky flavor, really nails the savory craving. Has a good combination of textures with the various level of crunch from the granola to the peanuts.",5,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but the smoky bbq flavor was nailed and tastes delicious with the perfect amount of crunch.",A little bit of sweetness or spiciness to take the flavor to another level.
623,8,"Has a good crunch, the smoky bbq flavor really compliments the roasted peanuts, very savory and delicious.",5,"I've got more of a sweet tooth, so I wasn't sure how a savory bar would taste, but I love it. It's surprisingly craveable and makes you want to keep eating it.",I'd add just a hint of sweetness to offset the smoky flavor.
802,7,"Great crunch, seemed a little bit thicker so a little more filling.",4,Had a great crunch and the flavor itself was pretty good.,"Could have been a little more flavorful, tasted as much peanut as smoky bbq."
581,7,"I like the crunch of the product and the appearance is still good, but not as good as the last product. The smoky BBQ flavor is good and maybe for people who like a milder flavored product, would be good.",2,"I expected more peanuts, more crunch, more savory BBQ flavor","More nuts, more BBQ savory flavor"
623,9,"I like the appearance of  real food , meaning, not a mash-up of items I can't figure out.. I like that it doesn't fall apart either when I'm eating it, the bar holds up. I really like the smoky savory flavor of the bar, and wouldn't even consider it sweet, tho I know sweet plays into savory... but it's the smoky essence of this savory flavor where sweet is only part of the combo, but still hidden so as not to stand out. It also seems to be the strongest flavor of the 3 bars and I do like that.",5,"Sometimes with a mass produced marketed product, expectations can be a bit blah.. but this bar harkens to those mixes you get in the office that are in loose item dispensers and the flavor profile is really good.. texture and taste. I really didn't expect this bar to taste this good, so I was pleasantly surprised.","As I'm more on protein and less on carbs, but a smidge more peanuts and less rice... but not sure if the rice is also providing a binding agent... but I really like nuts, especially peanuts, so if you can add a bit more, that would be great."
802,8,"It has more peanuts than the last sample, but could always use more.. good flavor profile, I like the savory bite it gives and leaves, good crunch for texture fix, and I like that I can see the ingredients",4,Not always sure what to expect with 'bars'.. this one has nuts and seeds and I like that wholesome profile and the flavor is better than I expected,"More peanuts, always"
581,1,nothing,1,"too hard, too dry, not much flavor","everything from looks, texture, taste"
623,1,nothing,1,It didn't meet my expectation. I did not taste the smoky flavor or the bbq flavor. Plus it's too hard,"texture, flavor, look"
802,1,nothing,1,I didn't like anything about it,"the look, the taste, the texture, the hardness, the crunchiness"
581,8,This bar had the perfect balance of bbq flavor and granola crunch. The bbq flavor is subtle at first but then comes in nicely after a few seconds and isn't too full or overwhelming.,5,I feel this would be the perfect bbq snack bar.  The bbq flavor is just right and isn't too full and it blends nicely with the nuts and seeds without drowning out the taste of them.,Nothing.  I feel this one would be the perfect bbq snack bar from Nature Valley.
623,8,The product is really flavorful and you can definitely taste the nut as well as the bbq flavor upon first bite.  The bar is savory and crunchy and the flavor wasn't overwhelming.  The bbq adds a nice kick to it.,4,"It was full of flavor and was definitely enjoyable whereas I expected it to be a bit on the lighter side and more of a granola crunch, given it's Nature Valley; but this had both.","I liked the fully packed flavor, but I can see how it can be a little bit too much for some people. The taste of it also reminded me of BBQ Pringles which doesn't really make this snack unique or different.  It just felt like I was eating a BBQ snack in a different form.  Lastly, there was a lot seasoning that got on my fingers so it can be a bit crumby/messy."
802,4,"Had a nice crunch to it, but overall, did not really like this bar.",1,It just wasn't good at all.  The bbq flavor was too light and I couldn't really make out the taste of anything else.  it felt  fake  and artificial.,"The bbq flavor was too light and subtle and with that, the bar tasted a bit artificial."
581,3,"Not a whole lot, to be honest. The crunchiness is good, and it seems fairly wholesome.",2,"The BBQ flavor is weird, and the overall taste just isn't very good.","Make the BBQ flavor more intense. There's some strange underlying flavor that I dislike, and it's just not great."
623,7,"It's definitely a Nature Valley bar, crunchy and a bit crumbly. The BBQ flavor is surprisingly decent, it's a little smoky and a tiny bit spicy. Overall, not bad.",3,"I honestly didn't know what to think, I kind of just took it with open arms and didn't have many pre-existing expectations when coming into it.","Not sure, to be honest."
802,3,"The crunch and texture are good, I guess.",2,"It barely tastes like BBQ, it's somehow sweet and savory but not in a great way. The flavor is just a little gross.","Less sweetness in the BBQ, and just a better BBQ flavor overall."
581,8,taste is savory and its crunchy,3,tastes about like I thought it would by the description,make the bbq flavor a bit stronger
623,8,Like the savory and crunchy taste,3,it was about what I expected it to taste,make the bbq flavor just a bit stronger
802,8,tasty savory and crunchy,3,tastes about like I thought it would,add a bit more bbq flavor
581,8,"I like that is sweet, salty, savory and crunchy.",3,I expected a crunchy bar with a sweet but savory bbq flavor.,I would like to taste more of the different seeds.
623,3,I like that is has a savory taste and I like that it’s crunchy.,2,I expected a sweet and salty bbq flavor but it taste bitter and salty.,It tastes bitter and it needs a little more sweetness
802,2,I like the crunchiness and the savory taste.,2,I wanted it to be sweeter and more crunchy,I would use less bbq flavoring and add more sweetness. I would also make the bar a little harder. It fell apart too easy.
