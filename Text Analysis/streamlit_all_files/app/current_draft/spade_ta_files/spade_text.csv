590,4,Looks appealing as you can see the cinnamon and frosting is attractive.,3,Really the size is smaller than mini falling into bite-size category. It has more of a doughy texture and is more like a soft cookie than a roll. This one is almost too sweet without enough cinnamon to balance out.
590,6,The cinnamon flavor I can really taste and liked the frosting not tasting chalky.,3,"less frosting and not as chewy. When I think of cinnamon rolls, I think of fluffy and not chewy. Also I thought the mini cinnamon rolls will be a little bigger. These were micro size."

590,4,It a lot other than it had more frosting,2,It tastes like fake or imitation cinnamon. Leaves weird aftertaste kinda like the fake aspartame does
590,3,I liked the cinnamon flavor and the amount of frosting.,3,"It was much too dense and chewy for me. I expected it to be flakier. Also, it was much more condensed than the picture."
254,3,I like that it wasn’t too sweet.,3,"The amount of cinnamon makes it somewhat bitter, and there’s also a bit of a sourness to the flavor. I would make it flakier, tone down the cinnamon, and add a bit more frosting."

590,6,Size good for quick breakfast,3,Maybe could be heated up
254,5,Size,4,More frosting
254,5,Taste was dry not very appealing,4,More flavor or chewiness
590,4,The frosting,3,Not soft enough should be served warm
590,9,"I could eat the whole roll in one bite, and it wasn’t to big for my mouth to do so. Perfect size",5,"It’s perfect, I would change nothing"
254,8,Can eat the whole roll in one bite,4,Add more frosting
254,4,I enjoyed the flavor of the cinnamon roll.  The size was about right for a mini cinnamon roll.,3,The texture was not what I expected and not like any cinnamon roll I’ve tasted.  It was chewy and more dense than I would like.
590,7,I like the flavor and sweetness of the cinnamon roll.  The cinnamon roll had a generous amount of frosting.,4,The cinnamon roll was much too chewy.  The texture reminded me more of a cookie than a cinnamon roll.
590,2,Cinnamon flavor was good,1,Bad after taste/too small
254,3,Good flavor,2,Bigger size and more frosting
254,8,The bite sized cinnamon flavor with sweet after tastes.,1,It was a little grainy.
590,9,Great flavor notes of cinnamon with the right amount of sweetness.,1,A little bigger in size and a smidge less grit.
590,1,I didn’t like anything. It was disgusting.,1,It needs less cinnamon and a doughier texture. It is more like a cookie than a roll. The flavor was very off.
254,1,This is very disappointing. I miss the dough. Gross.,1,It needs to be more doughy. It needs more natural flavoring.
254,2,The flavor was great and it was the taste of a cinnamon roll,2,The texture was horrible it was extremely dry and was more the a biscuit type of cookie
590,2,I really like the amount of sweetness because it’s not overly sweet and the cinnamon flavor was just enough,2,The texture was way off it was not  soft like a real cinnamon roll and was like biscuit
590,6,It reminded me of Christmas meaning the flavor. Maybe this should be a fall or winter special like the pumpkin spice.,2,Make them look more like cinnamon rolls they look like cookies with frosting.
254,5,Nothing really it just didn't do it for me,2,The texture it’s just too chewy in my mouth.
254,1,I liked nothing about it.,1,This tastes like an under baked cookie and not a cinnamon roll. Make it taste less like dough.
590,1,Nothing. Cinnamon flavor was ok.,1,Make it taste less like a cookie and more like a cinnamon roll.
590,8,The clusters of cinnamon were great as well as the flavor.,5,The icing didn't have much flavor. A cream cheese taste would’ve been nice.
254,7,The icing looked better than being drenched in it.,5,"A little more icing, more flavorful icing, more cinnamon, and a roll appearance would be nice."
254,4,Frosting and cinnamon flavor,2,"Texture tastes too chewy and unbaked, too much like dough"
590,7,Like lots off frosting and size,4,Too chewy and doughy tasting to me
590,4,The flavor is spot on with like a Cinnabon product ~ which is yummy,3,It’s much too dense like a thick chewy cookie or browny bite. A cinnamoroll should be more pastry like
254,2,"I think the cinnamon flavor is good but otherwise, I don’t like this product much",1,It’s needs to be more of a pastry. This is like a dense chewy cookie. I really wanted the texure of a cinnamon roll and not just the flavor.  This seems like a cinnamon roll flavored cookie or scone
254,8,The taste is good. Not the same texture of a normal cinnamon roll but I still liked it very much.,4,A little too small
590,8,The texture,4,A little too small. Seems like a lot of frosting.
590,7,"The size and flavor. More specifically, the bite size and rich but sweet flavor.",2,Make it slightly larger.
254,6,The texture and moistness.,2,"Add more frosting!,"
254,4,"The taste and size. The flavor was what I expected and the size was good, about two bites each.",1,"The texture and lack ofswirl. I would not call this a cinnamon roll, there was no roll to it."
590,3,The frosting was a better proportion. The flavor was good. Lots of cinnamon.,2,The texture. It tastes like a squished muffin. It has NO SWIRL!
590,3,The flavor of the icing,2,I think I would make it so it could be heated up and/or just more cookie-like. Meaning the texture is too dense and chewy
254,4,Size,2,More frosting and cinnamon flavor. I did not like the texture it was too chewy. It would be better if it was crunchy and marketed as a cookie
254,6,How dense in texture this was. Very good.,3,Put a little more cinnamon
590,9,"Flavorful, full of texture, freshness and just the right amount of frosting.",5,"Nothing. This is absolutely perfect,"
590,7,Appearance was nice and consistent. Good consistency between both rolls.,3,Less grainy texture and more cinnamon flavor
254,8,Great combination of flavor and texture. Packaging looks reflective of product,5,Slightly larger size would be good. Reduce count and increase size to make it seem healthier. “I only had one…”?
